    <h3>The Interplay of Love and Commitment <hr></h3>

   

    <article class="chapter-content" style=" font-size: 20px; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); color: lightgray;">
        <h1>Chapter 29: Successful Marriages and Families</h1>
        <section class="theory" style="margin:2em;">
            <p>In "Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives," we can align the triangular theory of love, which consists of intimacy, passion, and commitment, with the principles outlined by Lloyd D. Newell.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="intimacy" style="margin: 2em;">
            <h2>Intimacy</h2>
            <p>Intimacy, in the context of the proclamation, is the emotional feelings of closeness and bond between two people. Newell notes that the proclamation offers guidance for individuals to form these deep connections through shared eternal truths, which counteract a culture of "throwaway relationships" (Newell, 2012, p. 319). The proclamation emphasizes the value of eternal family relations and the perspective it provides can be seen as a means to cultivate intimacy that is rooted in spiritual and emotional union, essential for the foundation of a strong family.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="passion" style="margin: 2em;">
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>Passion, involving romantic and physical attraction, is also present in Newell's discussion, albeit in a more implicit form. He highlights the importance of "wholesome recreational activities" and a culture of love and respect within the family (Newell, 2012, p. 324). While not explicitly referring to romantic or sexual passion, the proclamation encourages an environment where such feelings can flourish within the sacred bounds of marriage, contributing to the overall strength and unity of the family.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="commitment" style="margin: 2em;">
            <h2>Commitment</h2>
            <p>Commitment, the intentional and conscious part of a loving relationship, is strongly underscored in Newell's analysis. The proclamation is described as a "stern warning in a world where declining values and misplaced priorities threaten to destroy society by undermining its basic unit" (Newell, 2012, p. 319). This reflects the deep level of commitment necessary to uphold the family as the fundamental unit of society, as encouraged by the proclamation. It is a commitment not just between spouses, but also between family members and to the divine principles that govern family life.</p>
