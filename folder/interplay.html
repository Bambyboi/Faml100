            <p>In "Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives," 
                we can align the triangular theory of love, which consists of intimacy, passion, and commitment, 
                with the principles outlined by Lloyd D. Newell.</p>

        <section class="intimacy">
            <h2>Intimacy</h2>
            <p>  
                
                Intimacy in a relationship is when couples have the feeling of being close, emotionally connected, 
                and supporting each other. It means being able to share a whole range of thoughts, feelings, and 
                opinions that they both have to improve their family and contribute to their parenting roles equally. 
                This is also mentioned in the proclamation: intimacy is when two people have a close bond and share 
                feelings for each other. Newell shared the things that stop couples from experiencing intimacy and 
                building strong families. He said, "More than ever, families are under attack. A culture of throwaway 
                relationships; familial apathy and permissive values; and secularism, selfishness, and immorality has 
                made the responsibility to build strong families more challenging" (Nowell, p. 319). Therefore, a 
                culture of throwaway relationships means when something is broken in a relationship or they have problems, 
                they need to throw it away instead of taking time to fix it; familial apathy means a lack of emotions; 
                permissive values mean forcing one another to do something that he or she doesn't agree on; and secularism 
                means having a divorce or splitting up because of a different religion; selfishness means when husbands 
                or wives receive things without receiving any favors in return; and immorality means sexual marriage 
                outside of marriage has made the responsibility to build strong families more challenging and more important.
                <br>
                <br>
                Elder Richard G. Scott said, “Any sexual intimacy outside of the bonds of marriage—I mean any intentional 
                contact with the sacred, private parts of another's body, with or without clothing—is a sin and is 
                forbidden by God” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1994, 51; or Ensign, Nov. 1994, 38). Elder Scott said 
                that when couples have any sexual feelings or intercourse outside of marriage, it's a sin that God 
                will never forgive or forbid. This is a warning for couples that they need to commit to keeping it.

        <section class="passion" >
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>
                When a relationship is just getting started, passions are often something you would love to do constantly. It's defined 
                by both deep feelings of emotion and strong sexual attraction of the things they love to do or seem to be 
                obsessed with, that each of them want to spend as much time with each other. 
                Therefore, "husbands and wives needs to help one another 
                as equal partner and to love and care for each other and for their children" (Nowell, p. 323). Therefore,
                for me the true passion in a relationship is not just having emotion but a have
                commitment to mutual support, love, and care each other and their children. As I interviewed my older sister 
                that was married for 3 years now. I told her what are the things that you and your partner can do to bring 
                passion love in your family. She said, shared commitment to uphold and 
                cherish our roles within our family will help them nurturing our love, respecting each other's 
                duties contribution, and create an environment that her family feel happy and everlasting. 
                Nowell highlights the importance of wholesome recreational activities 
                and a culture of love and respect within the family. In families who find true happiness 
                comes from “faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and whole-some 
                recreational activities” (Newell, 2012, p. 324). Therefore, these are ways that couples need to do to achieve
                happy marriage and family as mentioned by Newell. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We all know that satan is trying to tempted us with unfaithful decision making, that cause couples from not 
                dishonest of keeping their marriage vows. He always try to tempted us to have sex before marriage, and infidelity
                will find happiness. To avoid these, I will like to bring a short story in the bible. I guess we heard 
                the story that satan tempted Jesus to turn the stone into bread when Jesus fasted for 40 days. As Jesus respond, 
                "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_4:4#:~:text='Man%20shall%20not%20live%20by,of%20the%20mouth%20of%20God."
                style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank">see</a>, 
                Mathew 4:4). We can use this example in our family or marriage. When Satan is trying to break our family bond through 
                various of temptation, if we try to convince our brain that you don't sexual feelings outside of marriage, your body 
                will remind you that you do, which can lead you to stressed, worn out, and feeling overwhelmed. But if we approach sexual 
                desire as our Savior towards the food. We will have success in bridling your feelings and overcome satan's temptation. 
                In the ensign of August 2020 <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2020/08/young-adults/bridling-your-passions-how-to-align-sexual-thoughts-and-feelings-with-the-lords-expectations?lang=eng" style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank">
                Bridling Your Passions: How to Align Sexual Thoughts and Feelings with the Lord's Expectations</a> it mentioned a 
                quote that "living the law of chastity invites some of the greatest blessings men and women can receive in mortality: 
                appropriate spiritual confidence in the presence of family, friends, Church associates, and, ultimately, the Savior."

        <section class="commitment" >
            <h2>Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                Commitment in partnership can make couples happy by committing in supporting each other, treat other with 
                respect, have equal mindset in decision making, show consistency care and love, and spending time together 
                in recreational activity. In the proclamation, it shares how important the proclamation help couples to 
                shapening their relationship stronger. One recreational activity that I like to suggest the couples need to do in their 
                family, by committing to memorize the proclamation. This could help them to remember 
                the guidance of a proclamation not only to them, but their children also. "It took almost a year, 
                but we memorized the entire family 
                proclamation together. Although this might not be possible for every family, it has proven a blessing 
                for ours. . . . Our children have been exposed to activities, debates, and friends that do not support 
                the Lord's view of the family. I am so grateful to know that they have the words of the Lord's chosen 
                servants when needed" ( Johnson, 2009, p. 12). Therefore, having this kind of recreational activity in 
                family will help them and their children to understand the Lord's view of the family, and to share it's teachings to others that don't 
                understand the family proclamation. Nowell gathered some response from the his student about the impact of the 
                family proclamation to them. One of his student name Stephanie shared, "I always keep a proclamation posted by my desk with a picture of my family so 
                I can remember to follow it. . . . Whenever questioned with why I want to be a mom, I can proudly say because 
                that is my divine role. A loving Heavenly Father gave this divine role to me. He will entrust me with 
                his children to raise them in righteousness in the gospel" (Nowell, p.319). Although, Parents need to apply 
                commitment in teaching their children to learn about the family proclamation. So they could build their own happy 
                family when they get married. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Personally, reading all the story that was mentioned my Nowell help me to share the 
                family proclamation in family every first week of the month, so we can have a discussion of the things that we need 
                to improve in our family. In public policy agenda to help couples form and sustain healthy, stable marriages by Hawkwins.
                He shared that teaching the family proclamation to children "help them to understand and create a path to marital success" 
                (Hawkins et al., ch25). By avoiding, "serial sexual partnerships appear 
                to be a risk for maintaining stable marriages" (Heaton, 2002; Teachman, 2003), and "cohabitation before 
                engagement also increases the risk factor for eventual divorce" (Jose, O'Leary, & Moyer, 2010; Rhoades 
                et al., 2009). Thus, family proclamation can prevent children these serious kind of issues and help them to 
                learn chastity and the sacredness of marriage vows.
