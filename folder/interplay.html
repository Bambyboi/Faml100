            <p>In "Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives," 
                we can align the triangular theory of love, which consists of intimacy, passion, and commitment, 
                with the principles outlined by Lloyd D. Newell.</p>

        <section class="intimacy" style="margin: 1em;">
            <h2>Intimacy</h2>
            <p>  
                
                Intimacy in a relationship is when couples have feeling of being close, emotionally connected, and supported each other. 
                It means being able to share a whole range of thoughts, feelings, and opinions that they both have to improve their 
                family and contribute their parenting role equally. This is also mentioned in the proclamation 
                that intimacy is when two people have close bond and share feelings for each other. Newell shared the things 
                that stop couples to experience intimacy and building strong family. He said 
                "More than ever, families are under attack. A culture of throwaway relationships; familial apathy and 
                permissive values; and secularism, selfishness, and immorality has made the responsibility to build 
                strong families more challenging" (Nowell, p. 319). Therefore, a culture of throwaway relationships
                means when something is broken in a relationship or they problems, they need to throw it away, 
                instead of taking time to fix it; familial apathy means lack of emotions and permissive values means 
                forcing one another to do something that he or she don't agree on; 
                and secularism means having a divorce or splitting up because of different religion, selfishness means 
                when husbands or wifes recieved things without no favors in return, and immorality means 
                sexual marriage outside of marriage has made the responsibility to build strong families more challenging 
                and more important.

        <section class="passion" style="margin: 1em;">
            <h2>Passion</h2>
            <p>
                When a relationship is just getting started, passions are often something you would love to do constantly. It's defined 
                by both deep feelings of emotion and strong sexual attraction of the things they love to do or seem to be 
                obsessed with, that each of them want to spend as much time with each other. 
                Therefore, "husbands and wives needs to help one another 
                as equal partner and to love and care for each other and for their children" (Nowell, p. 323). Therefore,
                for me the true passion in a relationship is not just having emotion but a have
                commitment to mutual support, love, and care each other and their children. As I interviewed my older sister 
                that was married for 3 years now. I told her what are the things that you and your partner can do to bring 
                passion love in your family. She said, shared commitment to uphold and 
                cherish our roles within our family will help them nurturing our love, respecting each other's 
                duties contribution, and create an environment that her family feel happy and everlasting. 
                Nowell highlights the importance of wholesome recreational activities 
                and a culture of love and respect within the family. In families who find true happiness 
                comes from “faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and whole-some 
                recreational activities” (Newell, 2012, p. 324). Therefore, these are ways that couples need to do to achieve
                happy marriage and family as mentioned by Newell.

        <section class="commitment" style="margin: 1em;">
            <h2>Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                Commitment in partnership can make couples happy by committing in supporting each other, treat other with 
                respect, have equal mindset in decision making, show consistency care and love, and spending time together 
                in recreational activity. In the proclamation, it shares how important the proclamation help couples to 
                shapening their relationship stronger. One recreational activity that I like to suggest the couples need to do in their 
                family, by committing to memorize the proclamation. This could help them to remember 
                the guidance of a proclamation not only to them, but their children also. "It took almost a year, 
                but we memorized the entire family 
                proclamation together. Although this might not be possible for every family, it has proven a blessing 
                for ours. . . . Our children have been exposed to activities, debates, and friends that do not support 
                the Lord's view of the family. I am so grateful to know that they have the words of the Lord's chosen 
                servants when needed" ( Johnson, 2009, p. 12). Therefore, having this kind of recreational activity in 
                family will help them and their children to understand the Lord's view of the family, and to share it's teachings to others that don't 
                understand the family proclamation. Nowell gathered some response from the his student about the impact of the 
                family proclamation to them. One of his student name Stephanie shared, "I always keep a proclamation posted by my desk with a picture of my family so 
                I can remember to follow it. . . . Whenever questioned with why I want to be a mom, I can proudly say because 
                that is my divine role. A loving Heavenly Father gave this divine role to me. He will entrust me with 
                his children to raise them in righteousness in the gospel" (Nowell, p.319). Although, Parents need to apply 
                commitment in teaching their children to learn about the family proclamation. So they could build their own happy 
                family when they get married. Personally, reading all the story that was mentioned my Nowell help me to share the 
                family proclamation in family every first week of the month, so we can have a discussion of the things that we need 
                to improve in our family. In public policy agenda to help couples form and sustain healthy, stable marriages by Hawkwins.
                He shared that teaching the family proclamation to children "help them to understand and create a path to marital success" 
                (Hawkins et al., ch25). By avoiding, "serial sexual partnerships appear 
                to be a risk for maintaining stable marriages" (Heaton, 2002; Teachman, 2003), and "cohabitation before 
                engagement also increases the risk factor for eventual divorce" (Jose, O'Leary, & Moyer, 2010; Rhoades 
                et al., 2009). Thus, family proclamation can prevent children these serious kind of issues and help them to 
                learn chastity and the sacredness of marriage vows.
