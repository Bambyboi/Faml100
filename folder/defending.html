    <h3>Defending and Sharing Family Principles <hr></h3>

    <div class="">
       <h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; text-align: left;">
        To demonstrate defending and sharing family principles to the world-wide requires a better 
        and honest communication about the family values like parenting. This will not only help our individual family, but to help the 
        community aswell which was stated by our prophet Joseph Smith. <i>"When we gain a witness of the truth, we will not be 
        “content with blessing [our] family alone, but [range] through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole
         human race”</i> (Smith, 1976, p. 227). Therefore, As we share the principles of the proclamation with others, 
         we can fulfill that directive to preach and warn our neighbors, helping them strengthen their families.

                <strong>Students Share and Defend Experiences with LDS Family Members and Friends</strong> 
                
                <p>

                  In this chapter 34 I have learned so many great example of family values we can apply to anyone around us but 
                  specially in our family. Such as Sanctity of life, Maturnal nurturing, family compassion, 
                  family forgiveness towards each other. Having an Open communication with anyone who face hard decision or 
                  challanges in life, we will able help them by sharing family values I listed above. 

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Sanctity of life:</strong> In Chapter 34, I came through some of the great stories about sharing Sanctity of life. 
                    In my personal example, when we come accross any couples that go through any problems of killing a baby or 
                    known as abort the baby due to the couples issues like financial issues or couples issues. 
                    Sharing this proclamation teachings 
                    to the world-wide or anybody around us will help everyone or couples that go through any issues like this. 
                    "We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God's eternal plan. . . . Children are entitled 
                    to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital 
                    vows with complete fidelity" (Hawkwins, ch34, p. 362). Therefore, children must born in parents that honor marital vows.
                    Through an open communication with them, we are able shared this to them for letting them choose the right 
                    decision. I am so grateful for the church teachings that help me and you to apply these principles in our family to increase 
                    our family bond.  
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <img src="assets/images/sanctity.jpg" alt="familyvalues" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Maturnal nurturing:</strong> In Mother parenting role, some childrens feels like complaints about their parent's
                    overbearing, overprotective, and hypercritical. By avoiding this issues, parents and the children
                    must have an open communication to share thoughts about this issues and figure out how they avoid this issues. 
                    As I studied the proclamation principle mentioned in chapter 34, there was a quotes mentioned by Mary as she shared her personal story.
                    “Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children” (Mary, ch34, p. 326) and She pointed out why 
                    mothers sometimes seem overbearing because they care so deeply for the happiness of their children 
                    and their Godgiven responsibility to “rear their children in love and righteousness”(Mary, ch34, p. 326).
                    So maturnal nurturing, parents or Mother must provide the needs of their children. Like
                    cook good food, cleaning, provide clean clothing, teach them, include them in family life, 
                    encourage, teach and play with, and provide protection.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Family compassion:</strong> In this chapter, Father parenting role was mentioned. We all know that father is very strict
                    in every family, because father is the head of the family. In my personal experience, I have a cousin that is 
                    addicted to pornography and his father is so strict and he could actually throw him outside the house when he 
                    finds out about his son's addiction. One night we had a family home evening, we gathered together and I was 
                    assigned to offer a small short spiritual thoughts. I shared about reach out in compassion which was one of the 
                    article in <a target="_blank" style="color: blanchedalmond;" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2018/07/reach-out-in-compassion?lang=eng">
                      (Liahona, 2018) 
                    </a>. I summarized the article and shared them about Jesus Christ our Savior, he 
                    showed compassion to the people that he healed during his mission. No matter how unworthy the people, 
                    our Savior healed them with compassion, love, and kindness. Our Heavenly Father wants His children to be 
                    compassionate (1 Corinthians 12:25-27). To become true disciples, we must develop 
                    and show compassion to others, especially to those in need (D&C 52:40). Therefore, I let my cousin's father 
                    know about the issues during our open communication with him and give him a remindful advice from the 
                    article that he should teach him with compassion. So in the end he understand and willing to help his son 
                    with an open communication with him, together with applying compassion.   

                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <strong>Family Forgiveness:</strong> Applying family forgiveness in family and towards each member of the family, will 
                    enhance the family relationship bond stronger and firm. As Hawkwins mentioned some of the stories about 
                    this proclamation teachings. He stated out a story between three sister that the younger sister stole 
                    the car key of the middle sister name Maggie, and she sneaked out and had an enjoyed ride till she got 
                    pulled over by the police. Then Trisha the younger sister told the police the wrong information about 
                    mentioned Maggie's name. Maggie recieved speeding ticked arrived in her email and she got mad and decided 
                    to not forgive her younger sister Trisha. Trisha then called her eldest sister name Anna and shared with 
                    her the unforgivable thoughts towards her younger sister Trisha. Anna told her "that she had a 
                    spiritual duty to forgive all and that harboring this anger and resentment would only canker her own 
                    soul. Forgiving, as difficult as it can be, would be liberating for her". Maggie changed her mind with tears 
                    and decided to forgive his younger sister to make their bond come closer and increase their level happiness 
                    (Hawkins, ch34, p. 363).

                  <!--Chapter 34 serves as a compelling example of how family values can be actively promoted through 
                  communication and advocacy. Acknowledging the societal call for individuals to support policies 
                  preserving the family as a cornerstone, the chapter emphasized the role of open communication in 
                  strengthening marriages and reinforcing family values like commitment and respect. This resonates 
                  with a real-life scenario where a community organization takes a proactive stance by organizing 
                  events and workshops, collaborating with experts to disseminate information on effective communication 
                  and parenting skills. Mirroring the chapter's emphasis, the organization actively engages in community 
                  outreach, sharing personal stories and partnering with local institutions to create a supportive network 
                  for families. Together, Chapter 34 and the community initiative illustrate the transformative impact 
                  of actively defending and sharing family principles, fostering a culture that values and prioritizes the 
                  well-being of families (Hawkins, 2024).-->

                  Eventually, I have gained so much guidance from these proclamation teachings that we can apply to not 
                  only our family but to the large environment but specially in couples. Applying this in couples will 
                  help them to avoid so much issues and removing past mistakes to enhance their relationship bond. Also 
                  in
                  <a style="color: blanchedalmond;" href='https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/the-eternal-family-teacher-material-2022/lesson-27-teacher-material?lang=eng' target="_blank">Julie B. Beck</a> 
                   the President of the Relief Society, that if we help to share these values to our neighbors,
                   we'll help the world to become much better place and reward us with much happiness and peace in our family
                   and individual's family. "We call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote 
                   those measures the proclamation teachings, designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society" (Beck, nd).
                   Because, it help students and everyone feel the truth and importance of doctrine and principles. 
                   They will likely to apply doctrine and principles when they feel their truth and importance through the 
                   Spirit and sense some urgency to incorporate them in their lives. One effective way to help them 
                   feel the truth and importance of doctrine and principles is to encourage them to reflect on and share 
                   personal experiences related to these proclamation teachings.

                  
                  <!--Hawkins (2012) explains the relationship that exists between the resilience of a society's family systems 
                  and its overall strength. The need of actively supporting family-centered values is discussed in Chapter 
                  34. This involves educating others, taking part in community discussions, and pushing for laws that 
                  maintain the integrity of the family, embracing values and behaviors that are good for parenting, especially 
                  those that come from our parents, and giving family love and togetherness the highest priority are 
                  important. Commitment to these values promotes loyalty, which helps strong and healthy relationships 
                  with relatives to form. Parents can effectively teach essential values and ethics in their children by 
                  emphasizing time spent together, which strengthens the foundation of a healthy and strong family. It is said 
                  that this kind of involvement is necessary for creating an environment in which families may thrive in 
                  the face of modern difficulties and guarantee the continued existence of a strong moral and ethical basis 
                  for next generations. This chapter promotes an active approach to family values by highlighting 
                  individuals as important change agents in a cultural movement that places an emphasis on the well-being 
                  and stability of families as the cornerstone of advancing society. -->

                <strong> Positive Community Influence</strong> 
                
                

                <p>
                  Hawkins (2012) emphasizes the direct impact of this kind of positive community influence, in which 
                  thoughtful and caring discussions not only change individual viewpoints but also help the general public 
                  value and strengthen families. According to the chapter, these interactions, which are based on empathy 
                  and respect, may eliminate misconceptions and provide a nurturing environment for families. Through 
                  providing community members with based on evidence viewpoints and moral guidelines related to family 
                  relationships, individuals can significantly contribute to the establishment of an environment that supports 
                  the well-being and stability of families.

                  As the image below illustrates, it was created in a school setting where educators encourage young 
                  children to use positive language every day to prevent arguments. These illustrations have a good 
                  social impact on both our family and the environment around us. Respectful language can assist spouses 
                  in a marriage demonstrate their regard for one another. For instance, as the image suggests, sayings like 
                  "thank you," "never hurt others," "kind," "help others," and so on can make someone feel valued and 
                  grateful and create strong bonds of trust among families.

                <strong> Empowerment Through Education </strong> 
                <p>
                  In Chapter 34, the transforming power of education is emphasized as a means of allowing people, 
                  especially students, to actively participate in conversations about family values including living 
                  together, the dignity of life, and building relationships. One example of how this is done is by presenting 
                  the Family Proclamation to increase understanding of Latter-day Saint teachings. The chapter shows 
                  how education positions people as change agents by preparing them to confront difficult social issues 
                  including family problems and pornography. In the end, Chapter 34 emphasizes how education helps 
                  people defend, share, and implement family values, which is good for one another and the larger community 
                  (Hawkins, 2024). 
                </p>

          

                <p>
                  In order to enable people and families to defend and spread family values, education is the key. 
                  Collaboration between early childhood educators and families becomes essential when using family-centered 
                  techniques because it acknowledges and involves families in decisions about the upbringing and education 
                  of their children. Education is essential for promoting family values because it helps students think 
                  critically about and relate their own experiences to these ideals, which strengthens their loyalty. 
                  Moreover, empowerment in educational settings involves helping people in expressing themselves in a 
                  way that is self-affirming based on their past, language, and traditions. This allows them to fully 
                  engage in their communities. It is stressed that working together, families and schools may create a 
                  complete approach to family life by enabling families to actively participate in their children's 
                  education and overcoming differences in perspectives.
