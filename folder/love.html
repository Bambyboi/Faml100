                    Promotion of stable marriage
                </h3>
                <p>In this chapter I have learned that Hawkwins encourage government and community to share 
                    a public policy agenda in educational and in public, to increase the stable marriage in 
                    family. He emphasize that marriage is the key to help the government to establish rules 
                    that help couples to follow to stable their marriage. Hawkwins said that modern marriage 
                    has been facing a problems such as political unrest, for example, like demonstrating 
                    protest to the community to stop abusing wives in familys’. “We call upon responsible 
                    citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain 
                    and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society” (Hawkwins, ch25). He suggested, 
                    promoting stable marriage in educational will help younger generations to reduce all the issues 
                    that cause, to broke the family relationship. Having these kind of educational program in school will 
                    bring so much great impact to the community to stop things that ruin marriage bonds.</p>

                    Supporting Families across Generations 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In this chapter 17 about "Supporting Families across Generations" by Richard B. Miller and Jeremy 
                    B. Yorgason. It mentioned the significance of extended family support in a time when life expectancy has increased. 
                    Therefore, connections between adult children, parents, and grandparents not only last longer but also 
                    provide important emotional and material support across generations. Research indicates that strong
                    supportive relationships still exist, even though before concerns that societal changes would weaken these
                    bonds, like adult children frequently live near to their parents and keep in regular contact. Furthermore, 
                    grandparents now play a more significant part in the lives of their grandchildren, with many of them taking 
                    an extended and active interest in them. This chapter also mentioned about the "isolated nuclear family (Parsons, 
                    1943, p.177)." This means when adults gets married, they likely lived with their spouse in their own homes, and 
                    cause them less interactions with their older family members. By eliminating the idea of the "isolated nuclear family" 
                    and highlighting the enduring connect between extended family members, this increased life expectancy 
                    and extension of family bonds highlight the essential value of generational support (Parsons, 1943, 
                    p.177).

                    Quality Time and Shared Experiences:
                </h3>
                <p>A marriage's ability to maintain emotional connection and closeness depends significantly
                     on spending quality time together. Regular date nights, partaking in interests or
                      activities together, or just spending quality time together without interruptions 
                      are a great examples of this. Together, you can develop stronger bonds and enduring 
                      memories through having exciting new experiences that will deepen your sense of love and mutual respect.
                      These ideas are intrinsically related to the ideas covered in Chapter 22 of "Successful 
                      Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives," which 
                      highlights the value of healthy recreational activities in promoting individual growth 
                      and harmony within families.
