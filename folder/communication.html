            perspectives and reinforcing shared values. Couples are encouraged to engage in conversations that not 
            only respect but also seek to understand differing viewpoints, thereby building a strong foundation of 
            empathy and shared values.

                    Forgiveness and Repentance
                </h3>
                <p> Worthington (2006) provided great explaination about the steps of forgiveness process and 
                    also the in LDS church's own process. Gardner and Greiner (2012) talk about how true faithfulness includes emotional and spiritual 
                    loyalty in addition to physical reliability. When these promises are broken, true repentance 
                    and open communication create the way for forgiveness (p. 59).
                    This highlights the close relationship that exists between the demonstrating forgiving 
                    and repentance and good communication, showing how important both steps to bring 
                    healing and strengthening marriage.</p>
                    
                <p> Repentance and forgiveness is "an interactive process that strengthens families" and  
                    "Two sides of the same coin" (Worthington, 2006). In family planning and the decision to have children 
                    are very personal topics that should be handled with openness, and respect. 
                    As couples work through their differences towards togetherness, these discussions 
                    must involve forgiveness and repentance to serves as further evidence that 
                    forgiveness and repent are essential to making decisions that are in line with both of them
                    ideals for settling conflicts.</p>

                    Enhancing Marital Recreation and Bonding
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Improving recreational and bonding in couples is very important of maintaining happy marriage,
                    because it involves in engaging activities that improve their happiness, intimacy, and understanding. Another
                    important thing about completing the engaging activities is to include time and efforts. This acitvities can
                    include anything from simple home projects like outdoors acitivities such as hiking, biking, sea walk, and etc. 
                    In addition to offering a break from everyday conflicts, these shared experiences give couples an environment on which to communicate, 
                    collaborate together, and enjoy each other's to provide them emotional connection (ch5).
                </p>

       

                <p>
                    Moreover, committing in attending recreational events and have been scheduling regularly, show how much
                    value or important your relationship are to you. To ensure that both couples feel satisfaction and happy in
                    their shared activity, commitment is needed together with open communication and understanding to each others
                    needs and interests. Couples can improve firm bonds by making time to each other so that they can have a strong
                    relationships based on respect and support each other. Orthner and Mancini (1990), emphasize three types of leisure activities that couples can do: parallel, joint, and independent. 
                    Of all of these three activities, researchers found that joint has the highest marital satisfaction in couples and family.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Hawkwins shared that couples need to stand up and shared the proclamation's teachings to other people
                    that was mentioned in this chapter such as sanctity of life, maturnal nurturing, 
                    family compassions, and family forgiveness. Doing this could help our community and our societal better. 
                    Couples can strengthen their marriage and provide good example to other by actively participate in
                    social discussions and activities that covers family values, so that we can stay in better environment with peaceful in our mind.
                    (Hawkins, ch 34)  
                    </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Moreover, open communication and understanding require to of sharing family principles. 
                    So that help other couples and family members achieve happy in family and peaceful marriage. For instance, "The Family: A Proclamation 
                    to the World" show values like respect for one another, empathy, and compassion could resolving
                    any issues our family go through. (Hawkins, Chapter 34).</p>
