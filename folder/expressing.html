    <h3>Promotion of stable marriage: <hr></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <div style="color: lightgrey; font-size: 20px;">
            <p>In this chapter, Hawkins said, "Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God...We call upon 
                responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to 
                maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society" (p. 269).  Hawkins said 
                that establishing public policy agenda in community will help to increasing stable marriage in couple. 
                I will like to share great example of this, in my country Samoa. In our country, we always have protest 
                for stop abusing in women and children. This policy was established by our government in 2005. Therefore, 
                right now I have seen so much improvement in our country and I barely hear anymore violence in family. 
                Before this policy, the percentage of violence in our country was high comparing it today’s percentage. 
                It is important to encourage government to create their own policies for stable marriage. Hawkins also 
                mentioned that, "school-based relationship literacy for youth; positive relationship formation education 
                for young adults; and effective premarital education for engaged couples, as well as ongoing relationship 
                enrichment education in the early years of marriage" (p. 270). These suggestions will help children and 
                adults to gain so much knowledge about healthy relationships, and help them to understand the challenges 
                of both individual and societal that stop them from path to happy marriage. In my own opinion, the two 
                policies that government need to take action on, stop abusive and abortion. Hawkins said “for these 
                marriage-strengthening efforts to be integrated into a broader spectrum of social and economic policies, 
                thereby enhancing their effectiveness and ensuring a holistic approach to supporting families” (page. 271). 
                Therefore, stopping these issues will help strengthening family relationships and bring peace in to them.
            
                <br>
                <br>
                Hawkins shared that an empirical perspective, there are a number of known risk factors that 
                impede forming and sustaining healthy marriages, such as many premarital sexual partners (Teachman, 2003), 
                premarital parenthood (Amato & Booth, 2001), pre-engagement cohabitation (Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009), 
                and premarital relationship violence ( Jackson, 2009). To address these issues, In this chapter, Hawkins 
                set forth a modest public policy agenda to address this issue. The agenda stresses the availability 
                of a series of educational opportunities, including: (a) school-based relationship literacy for youth; 
                (b) posi-tive relationship formation education for young adults; and (c) effective premarital education 
                for engaged couples, as well as ongoing relationship enrichment education in the early years of marriage 
                to help couples learn the needed skills for a healthy marriage (Hawkins, ch25). Having these policies to our
                government to implement inside educational system, will help children and adults to understand ways to achieve 
                happy marriage and ways to solve these issues as such a young age. Also, to established greater environment for 
                generations to generations. This is how great government shows their love and affections towards the humanity.

                <h2>Healthy Relationship Skills: Helping Youth Learn about Healthy Relationships</h2>
               
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    <Strong>Implement Relationship Literacy program:</Strong> Hawkins shared that educating youth about 
                    healthy relationship through education will help them to understand the literacy programs. This will 
                    allows them to covered problem-solving, important of open communication, understand between 
                    good and bad relationship, and help youth to deal with violence and conflicts (Whitehead & Pearson, 2006).
                    Having relationship literacy program in education program will help all of us to have short term positive effects
                    on healthy relationship knowledge, decreased dating violence, and positive attitudes towards marital success as mentioned 
                    by (Gardner & Giese & Parrott, 2004).</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    
                    <strong>Target Programs to Diverse and At-Risk Youth:</strong> 
                    Developing youth relationship literacy, including programs targeted to at-risk, and disadvantaged youth.

                    </a> This link contain so much way of promoting relationshp literacy for youth. 
                    Because increased efforts to promote relationship literacy for youth. 
                    Also, it contains firstly, Healthy Relationships for Younger Teens
                    where Dibble works with younger teens to teach them healthy relationship skills early in their lives.
 
                     Secondly, Healthy Relationships for Older Teens & Young Adults where
                     Dibble’s materials teach teens and young adults how to be successful in friendships, dating, and love.
 
                     Last bot not least, Approaches to Addressing Trauma where
                     Dibble’s curriculum helps people of all ages take charge of their emotions and improve their 
                     states of minds and relationships. Kerpelman (2010) has demonstrated a relationship literacy program 
                    in Alabama youth, which help them reduce wrong beliefs about relationship and marriage. Therefore, Kerpelman 
                    witness that literacy program in education helped a lot of youth to understand how to achieve happy family and 
                    marriage.

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> 
                    
                   <strong>Targeted Relationship Education for Cohabiting Couples:</strong> 
                   To establish cohabiting relationship in education, they need to help young adult to learn different level of 
                   commitment and viewpoints on the future, and provide various of challanges for young adults while make their 
                   way toward marriage. This relationship education help adults to solve differenct kind of problems. 
                   "Slide into marriage rather than decide to marry with a firm commitment to the 
                   long-term future of the relationship" (Rhoades et al, 2009), adults will likely experience lack of 
                   commitment and affect the health and stability of their marriage. Therefore, cohabiting relationship 
                   should target by the educational for deepening their understand in commitment and the skills that are needed 
                   to create their marriage stronger and firm. This method aims to provide couples with everything they need 
                   for a happier, more secure marriage while emphasizing the importance of the premarital period. 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   One good example of relationship education targeted at cohabiting couples is the offering 
                   of "Pre-Commitment Education Programs." This program will assist premarital couples who are 
                   living together. Important subjects including family connections, financial planning, personal 
                   values, and future plans are some of the things that couples should learn in education. Program 
                   should contain decision making skills to help couples in actively choosing the course for their 
                   relationship so they could slide into greater commitments without mutual agreement. By 
                   strengthening the relationship, hopefully this program reduces the risk of cohabitation before 
                   to engagement and increase the chance of a happy marriage. 
                   <br>
                   <br>

                   Cohabitation before engagement also increases the risk factor for eventual divorce 
                   (Jose, O’Leary, & Moyer, 2010; Rhoades et al., 2009). Premarital parenthood, especially 
                   having children with multiple partners (McLanahan, 2009; Meyer, Cancian, & Cook, 2005), 
                   lowers the chances of future relationship and marriage success (Heaton, 2002; Jack-son, 2009).
                   And relationship violence in dating and cohabiting relationships continues to be a problem in the 
                   young adult years (Wood, McConnell, Moore, Clarkwest, & Hsueh, 2010) and can affect later marital 
                   success ( Jackson, 2009). Therefore, having these issues discussed in education course and find ways to 
                   encourage student or adults to solve these problems, will help each and everyone to achieve happy marriage.

                     <strong>Positive Relationship Formation Education for Disadvantaged Young Adults:</strong> 
                     Young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as those from low-income families or 
                     those without supportive role models in marriage, experience extra obstacles in developing 
                     committed, long-lasting partnerships. Relationship and marital outcomes for these people can 
                     be greatly impacted by relationship education specifically designed for them. As to the findings 
                     of Cox and Shirer (2009), a program designed for low-income parents of small children yielded 
                     "significant effects for communication and problem-solving skills and greater positive co-parenting 
                     attitudes and behaviors." In the same direction, positive results were found at one site with high 
                     participation levels in the Building Strong Families (BSF) study, which concentrated on low-income, 
                     newlywed couples and found "a pattern of significant, positive couple relationship and father 
                     involvement effects for African American couples" (Wood et al., 2010). These results highlight the 
                     relationship education to improve the romantic and parental relationships of young adults from poor 
                     backgrounds, indicating a need for more targeted and easily accessible for relationship education.

                     <br>
                     One good example of education for disadvantaged young adults, is this project of mine. Because, it's a
                     website and free accessible source for disadvantaged adults, to learn various ways of creating 
                     happy marriage. This how I show love and affection to those adults who have disadvantaged background.

                <h2>Helping Engaged Couples Build a Stronger Foundation for Marriage</h2>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> 
                    
                    <strong>Participation in Formal Premarital Education:</strong> 
                    
                    
                    It is important to provide formal 
                    premarital education in order to improve communication and problem-solving skills 
                    in engage couples, which are the key for overcoming the necessary difficulties of married life. 
                    According to Fawcett, Hawkins, Blanchard, & Carroll (2010), "premarital education for engaged 
                    couples is moderately effective at increasing couples’ communication skills" highlights the 
                    importance of this kind of training. Studies show that "couples who invest in formal premarital 
                    education are less likely to divorce in the early years of marriage" (Nock et al., 2008; Stanley, 
                    Amato, Johnson, & Markman, 2006), this emphasizes the programs' is working and help to lower early 
                    divorce rates in engage couples. It has been reported that "10 to 15 percent of couples taking premarital education 
                    classes call off the wedding because they come to believe that the relationship will not succeed" 
                    (Stanley, 2001) provides an example of the influence of these programs, showing that 
                    they help engage couples in making better decisions about their interaction and future together. 
                
                
                </li>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> 
                   <strong>Participation in Early Marital Enrichment Programs:</strong> Introducing the idea of 
                   relationship education into the early stages of a marriage through enrichment programs can improve 
                   the happiness in marriage. It has been shown that these programs "modestly improve 
                   communication skills and enhance relationship quality" (Hawkins, Blanchard, Baldwin, & Fawcett, 2008; 
                   Blanchard, Hawkins, Baldwin, & Fawcett, 2009). A study with an 11-year follow-up that revealed "a 
                   significantly lower divorce rate in the treatment group that received the enrichment program" 
                   (Hahlweg & Richter, 2010) it provides strong proof of a significant long-term benefit. As an example of 
                   this program's accessibility and potential influence on marriage stability, consider the PREP (Prevention 
                   and Relationship Enhancement Program) curriculum, which is commonly utilized in Oklahoma. It provides 
                   free classes that not only aim to improve couples' communication and problem-solving skills, but are also 
                   widely available in social environments specially to those who have disadvantaged backgroung.
