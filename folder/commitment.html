    <h3>Commitment and Partnership</h3>

                    Partnership Equality:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Partnership Equality means when both mother and father contribute their roles in responsible for 
                    caring the fairly and equal, so that each of them could become equal partners as a couples.  
                    In Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives chp4.
                    It emphasize that the "fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness 
                    and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. 
                    And Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred 
                    responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners" (Hudson & Miller, ch4). 

                    <!--The importance of communication in strengthening commitment in partnerships is emphasized in 
                    (Hudson & Miller, 2012, ch4). In Daily talks build understanding and trust, creating a solid relationship that 
                    endures difficulty. Honest communication and empathy for others are the foundation of true 
                    connection, and each action and statement strengthens the bonds of a partnership.-->
                    
                   </p>
                    <p>

                        Moreover, in my opinion having an open communication can let the couples determine their roles that they both 
                        need to work on as applying parenting roles when raising their childrens. 
                        For example, when mother and father 
                        are committed to working together on common family goals to set a great example of
                        supporting the child's life development. Therefore, parents commitment is require for 
                        establishing equal parenting in family such as, sharing the responsibilities, 
                        duties, and chores of parenting
                        equally between them. This will help them see appreciation and acknowledge
                        each other doings and meaningful contribution to the family and also to make them feel satisfy one another. 
                        
                        <!--A communication connection like this is more focused on developing the relationship than 
                        it is on satisfying its own need to control the conversation. Partners want to grow in 
                        peace, strengthening their relationship with every strand of mutual respect and understanding, 
                        rather than just live together, is an evidence to strength their loyalty. Commitment 
                        communication gives the partnership marriage improvement and keeps the commitment strong and 
                        alive in the face of challenges that life brings.-->

                    Strengthening Families
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the chapter 29 The Proclamation: A Guide, a Banner, and a
                    Doctrinal Summary of the Church's Emphasis on the Family by Lloyd D. Newell. This chapter mentioned so many way 
                    couples can do to increase intimacy, passion, and commitment in family. It also explained the role of 
                    couples in family as an equal partnership that I categorized it in intimacy, passion, and commitment. 
                    Intimacy means in proclamation is when two people have close bond and share feelings for each other.
                    Passion means something you would love to do constantly or defined by both couples have deep 
                    feelings of emotion and strong sexual attraction of the things they love to do.
                    And in committing is when two couples active every time in their couples activities, decision making, 
                    and family management. But this chapter 29, encourage parents to commit in teaching their 
                    children about the family proclamation to build strong happy family.  
                    </p>
                
               <!-- <p>When it comes to marriage, commitment establishes the foundation and gives love the stability it 
                    needs to grow and develop. The one thing that keeps the partnership moving in the changing tides 
                    of life is commitment, proving that moments of joy never destroy love. Love and commitment are 
                    essentially equal which strengthens each other in return. In a lack of love can appear empty, 
                    and in the midst of commitment, love might fail during challenging times. They provide an unbreakable 
                    bond that enables a marriage to overcome challenges and succeed representing the center of an entire 
                    journey and the mutual support that defines a long-lasting relationship (Newell, 2012).</p>-->

                    Overcome Challanges
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In the family proclamation The Warm, Happy Marriage: Cold, Hard Facts to Consider by VanDenBerghe and Hawkin.
                    this chapter has provided so much information to couples roles to do when it comes to 
                    challanges and problem solving. Also it explain the benefits of the marriage.
                    As I study this proclamation, I have come across solutions for these 
                    top issues in family, financial issue, child care issues, and lack of communication. 
                    Hawkwins provided some guidelines 
                    according to these issues. In Hawkwins research that "married people
                    are generally happier, greater life satisfaction, lower risk for depression, 
                    and greater economic stability, all these contributing to better mental health" (Scott et al., 2009; Stack & 
                    Eshleman, 1998; Wood, Goesling, & Avellar, 2007). He emphasize that couples synergy like when two people contribution greater 
                    together than they when independently. And this would known as equal in making decision, responsability, 
                    caring for their children. Having an equal partnership could help couples to solve problem easily and create 
                    a better environment with their family as they develop. Therefore, challanges could also help couples to 
                    strengthen their parenting role and figure out new things with new ideas to improve their family. (VanDenBerghe & Hawkin, ch.7).
