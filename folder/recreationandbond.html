    <h3>Enhancing Marital Recreation and Bonding <hr></h3>
  
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
      
      As I studied through Chapter 5, I learned so many things that spouses need to do to maintain strong 
      relationships. First, engaging in shared recreational activities could help couples have strong 
      communication and connection between them. I also learned from this chapter that regular participation 
      in enjoyable activities together will increase their level of satisfaction, communication, trust, sharing 
      laughter, gaining everlasting memories, and intimacy in their relationship. This will actually strengthen 
      their emotional bond between them (Harkwins et al., 2021).

    </p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
        Moreover, marital recreational activities need efforts and prioritize time. Which can improve 
        communication in any relationship. Gottman (1999) shared that spending much time together will 
        allow couples to increase their interactions with one another, gain much understanding, and openly 
        converse about their feelings and thoughts. In my personal thoughts, applying these to recreational 
        activities such as those that deal with physical interactions will help the couples create 
        opportunities, increase emotional connection, and enhance their marital bonds. One of the important 
        purposes of sexuality or physical interaction in marriage is to express love to each other, “to bind 
        husband and wife together in loyalty, fidelity, consideration, and common purpose” (The Church of Jesus 
        Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2004, p. 26).

      </p>
   
  

      <h3>Here are some of the Examples of recreational activities:</h3>
                <h2>Shared Activities: </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
                  Sharing activities, like any activity that allows couples to interact together and share their 
                  laughter, moments of happiness, and fun, This will actually make those shared activities their 
                  hobbies and help them spend as much time together as possible to make unforgettable memories. 
                  Also, in "Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives 
                  by Hawkins," it is emphasized that sharing activities can increase intimacy and clear understanding 
                  between partners. In chapter 5, it stated that "M. Holland (1998) explained that one of the benefits 
                  of marriage is to obtain peace of mind. He stated that the pleasure derived from sexual intercourse 
                  between a husband and wife is an example of happiness in the afterlife." Therefore, having physical 
                  activity with your partner, like sexual intercourse or any other related activity, could help husbands 
                  and wives increase their sexual intimacy. Additionally, there are some enjoyable activities on the list 
                  below that will enable them to demonstrate their interests, satisfaction, and support. "Shared activities 
                  can be rewarding and valuable in building a healthy marriage, but when spousal support of individual 
                  leisure interests wanes, marital satisfaction may be negatively affected." (Goff, Fick, & Oppliger, 1997).

                      Family Game Night could help couples experience laughters and work as a team in different sort
                      of indoor activity. Such as playing cards, video games, snake and ladder and
                      playing two truth and lie, where players make two truthful statements 
                      about themselves, along with a single lie. But it's anyone's guess which statement is the lie. It's 
                      another fun way to see how well you and your partner know each other compared to your friends.

                      This will allow couples to determine their favorite foods by preparing meals. This activity also enhance 
                      their parenting role when they have childrens. Since, childrens always hungry and parents need to know how

                      Including outdoors activity in sharing activities like throwing balloons, hiking, picnics, sea-walk, swimming, and 
                      other outdoors activity like sports will help couples to maintain physical health and gaining much
                      more interest towards each other.

                <h2>Communication in Physical affection.</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;"> 
                  
                  Having open communication with couples will let them gain a deeper understanding of sexual 
                  intercourse and behavior that needs to be established to enhance their physical interaction and 
                  marital bonding. In chapter 5, "If a wife begins to feel that physical touch from her husband is 
                  always a prelude to sexual interaction ending in intercourse, she will learn over time to avoid any 
                  kind of touching when she does not desire to be sexual." (Hawkins, chapter 5, p. 52) This reminds me 
                  of how important honesty is in communication, since they will establish their physical activity boundaries 
                  and avoid forcing interactions. This might also cause divorce in couples. Another great idea was mentioned 
                  by Gottman and Silver (1999): recommend the couples build and use a “love map.” A love map is like a 
                  physical or personal notebook where the couple collects personal information about each other that they 
                  want to remember. This notebook includes the spouse's dreams, joys, fears, likes, dislikes, frustrations, 
                  and worries. For example, if your partner doesn't hate spending a lot of money, then you must include that 
                  in your notebook to prevent arguments. </p>

                      <strong>Deepened Understanding:</strong> 
                      Including honest conversation in couples will help them identifies their personalities, dislikes, make choices, 
                      avoid doing things that makes each other worried and established boundaries between them to lessen 
                      their personal issues. Doing this need great performance as mentioned in chapter 5.  
                      <i>"Both spouses value abandoning a goal of perfect performance, 
                      which helps them overcome fears and pressures associated with sexual performance"</i> (Hawkins, chp5, p.53).  
                  
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-top: 1em;">
                      <strong>Enhanced sexual Intimacy:</strong>
                      Open communication can lead couples to improved by discussing ideas, emotions, and experiences as they 
                      plan to create an acitivity of sexual interactions that they love to do. Therefore,    
                      <i>Both spouses need to value and set aside time for physical intimacy, engage in affectionate touching, 
                      and establish a rhythm of sexual sharing</i> (McCarthy, 1998). This will increases their relationship to be more
                      firm.

                      <strong>Better Decision Making:</strong> 
                      Open communication will help couples to make the right decisions and decision is very important
                      in couples because, it shares their personal feelings when both of them taken things seriously 
                      which help spouses fulfilling experiences in physical affection decisions. 
                      <i>"Married couples should seek the inspira-tion of the Lord throughout their 
                      decision-making process. They should seek His help as they study the doctrines and the 
                      plan of salvation and consider their circumstances. They should seek His help in 
                      counseling together and arriving at a decision"</i> (Hawkwins, ch5, p.56).

                <h2>Prioritizing activities:</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
                  We all know that all of us are busy with work duties, family matters, and other things in this 
                  world, which causes us to spend less time with our own families. Prioritizing time in each 
                  situation will help us provide much more time with our own family and especially with our 
                  spouse's. At least prioritizing time for date nights and family dinners at restaurants will 
                  provide a closer relationship with our family. In my opinion, proclamation has blessed our 
                  family with clarity in a world of confusion. But Seymour shared that <i>“it has also helped us 
                  prioritize our activities, know our responsibilities, and recognize our blessings”</i> (Seymour, 2005, p. 127). </p>

                      also to strengthening their relationship bond.

                      responsability according with their needs of happiness. This also help couples to

                      their level of happiness and relationships satisfaction.

                  Positive interaction in couples recreational activity will increase the level of marital 
                  connection and greater satisfaction with less negative emotions or interactions. <i>"An important 
                  reason for equal partners having greater satisfaction is that they have less negative 
                  interaction and more positive interaction in their relationship"</i> (Gray-Little, Baucom, & Hamby, 1996). 
                  Having fun, laughter, and enjoyment in couples can help couples eliminate stress and deepen the marital 
                  connection (Gottman, 1999).</p>

                  Establishing traditions around recreational activities, such as annual vacations or weekly game nights, 
                  can provide a sense of stability and anticipation for couples. These traditions become cherished parts of 
                  the relationship's history (Doherty, 1997). Some scholars call these activities rituals. Doherty (1997) 
                  has suggested three kinds of rituals to help couples: connection rituals (to maintain the bond between 
                  two people) like setting time aside for couples validating conversations; love rituals (to keep the 
                  romance alive in marriage) like couples wedding anniversary; and celebration rituals (to show honor, 
                  love, and respect for each other) like gifting each other on individual birthdays.

                          couples to express their feelings together.

                          <strong>Renewal of Vows:</strong> 
                          Couples must show celebration when it comes to their wedding anniversary, so they could feel that they 
                          both value and important to each other.

      Orthner and Mancini (1990), emphasize three types of leisure activities that couples can do: parallel, joint, and independent. 
      Of all of these three activities, researchers found that joint has the highest marital satisfaction in couples.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <strong>Independent Activities:</strong> This is when one individuals engage in leisure acitivities without the involment of one another.</p>
      <ul style="color: lightgray; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Examples include:
      <li>Reading a Book: Curling up with a good book, lost in the world of words and imagination.</li>
      <li>Running or Jogging: Enjoying the outdoors while getting some exercise.</li>
      <li>Painting or Drawing: Expressing creativity on canvas or paper.</li>
      <li>Listening to Music: Relaxing with your favorite tunes.</li></ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <strong>Parallel Activities:</strong> 
      Parallel activities involve family members or friends participating in separate leisure pursuits side by side. 
      While there is shared time and space and minimal interaction.</p> 
      <ul style="color: lightgray; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Examples include:
      <li>Watching TV Together: Each person watches their preferred show.</li>
      <li>Cooking in the Kitchen: Preparing different dishes simultaneously.</li>
      <li>Working Out at the Gym: Using different exercise machines next to each other.</li></ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
        <strong>Joint Activities:</strong>
      Joint activities are collaborative and involve active interaction between one another. 
      These strengthen relationships and create shared experiences.</p> 
      <ul style="color: lightgray; font-size: 20px; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">Examples include:
      <li>Playing Board Games: Competing or cooperating with family or friends.</li>
      <li>Going for a Hike: Exploring nature together.</li>
      <li>Cooking a Meal Together: Collaborating on a recipe.</li>
      Dancing: Moving to the rhythm as a couple or group.</ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightgray; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%; padding-bottom: 2%;">
        As Orthner and Mancini shared that joint activities help couples or family to gain strong relationship and satisfaction in 
      marriage.</p>
