               Pitovao Faamaile - This is a great website. I have learned so much about the steps you provided about how to make your marriage and family happy. One important facts I learned from your website is the types of recreational activities can build our family and marriage happy. Like joint activities that collaborative and involve active interaction between one another. For example, dancing, cooking together, and playing games. Eventually, I will apply this principle in my future family, so that I will build my own family that contains joyful and happiness.
                Thank you

                Bamby Kaljess - This website has brought a great opportunity for the younger generation to learn how to achieve great marriage and happy family. This website has sharpened my understanding of how important open communication is in family. Having an open communication in family, will help family to open up their feelings to one another by sharing things that can enhance their family bonds. Thanks to this website that helped me to gain significant information's, of how to build a happy family and marriage while I'm still a teenager. Another good impact from this site is that it contains the principles of our Church the LDS. I'm guessing that this website is suitable for our church's youth and YSA.
