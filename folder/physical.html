                <h3>Intimacy in Marriages </h3>
                <h2 style="margin-top: 1em;">Tenderness and respect—never selfishness—must be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife.
                    —President Howard W. Hunter</h2>

            <li style="margin-top: 1em;">The scripture 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 emphasizes the role of physical intimacy within the marital relationship to prevent the temptation of fornication. The passage instructs that for a man and woman to avoid sexual immorality, they should enter into the commitment of marriage. It underscores the mutual responsibility of spouses toward each other's physical needs, emphasizing the concept of rendering due benevolence. This implies that both husband and wife have a shared obligation to fulfill each other's physical desires within the bounds of the marital relationship. The scriptural message also highlights the idea that, within marriage, the husband and wife do not have sole ownership of their bodies but share this intimacy exclusively with each other. The temporary withholding of physical intimacy for fasting and prayer is allowed with mutual consent, but the emphasis is on the importance of coming together again to prevent succumbing to the temptations of Satan due to a lack of self-control. In summary, this scripture underscores the significance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital relationship, portraying it as a means to fulfill each other's needs and strengthen the bond between spouses while guarding against immoral temptations.</li>

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    
                The concept of physical attraction is intricately interwoven with the teachings on intimacy within the context of marriage, as elucidated in the doctrinal perspectives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The teachings emphasize that tenderness and respect should be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife, asserting that the sacred powers of procreation are divinely appointed and are to be employed only within the bounds of a lawful marriage. This perspective is rooted in the belief that physical intimacy is not only a means of fulfilling the divine commandment to multiply and replenish the earth but is also an essential component of the love-inspired companionship between a man and a woman, promoting the development of higher faculties and nobler traits of human nature..</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    According to the teachings, the proper exercise of physical intimacy within the marital relationship is viewed as a sanctification of innate desires and sympathies, leading to life, happiness, and exaltation. The doctrine underscores that physical intimacy, when approached within the sacred covenant of marriage, is not merely a plaything or a means of satisfying passions and lusts but is a righteous and divinely approved expression of love. The emphasis extends beyond the physical aspect, highlighting the spiritual and emotional dimensions of love and affection. The teachings stress that true love transcends mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, understanding, unselfishness, sacrifice, and companionship with common ideals and standards.</li>

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> However, these teachings also emphasize the importance of maintaining the sanctity of physical intimacy within the boundaries set by God. Any sexual intimacy outside the bonds of marriage is considered a violation of divine commandments. The doctrines caution against misusing physical intimacy and underscore the need for cleanliness of thought and action within the intimate relationship between husband and wife. Thus, within the doctrinal framework of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, physical attraction is intricately connected to love and affection, and its proper expression is viewed as a sacred and divinely approved manifestation of marital intimacy.

                    Consider the case of Sarah and Mark in the image above, a married couple who adhere to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their relationship exemplifies the importance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital bond. Sarah and Mark prioritize tenderness, respect, and the sanctity of physical intimacy, adhering to the principles outlined in their faith. Their love goes beyond mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, and a deep understanding of each other. By approaching physical intimacy as a sacred and divinely approved expression of their commitment, Sarah and Mark strengthen their marital bond, fostering a sense of companionship rooted in common ideals and standards. This real-life example underscores how the principles of physical attraction within the framework of their faith contribute to the overall health and vitality of their marital relationship.
