    <h3>Supporting Families across Generations<hr></h3>

    <div class="container">

                <h2>Relationships between Adult Children and their Parents </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Researchers studying families have been looking at how adult children interact with their parents. This has made people question the idea that changes in society would lead to fewer interactions between the two generations. As people moved from the country to the cities in the early 1900s, experts predicted that family unity would weaken. They were afraid that adult children would grow apart from their parents when they had to move to towns for work and family reasons. This idea, which was summed up by Talcott Parsons' "isolated nuclear family" (1943), showed that ties between generations were not likely to get better in the future. Empirical studies, on the other hand, have shown that this myth is not true because many adult children still have close ties with their parents. Lye (1996) says that a large portion of adult children visit their parents regularly and maintain a strong emotional bond with them throughout their lives. Lawton, Silverstein, and Bengtson's (1994a) study shows that more than two-thirds of adult children talk to their parents at least once a week, if not every day. It seems likely that more than half of adult children live within an hour's drive of their parents based on this result. In addition, most people feel very close to their family members emotionally, which shows how strong these bonds are ("Lye, 1996").
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The connection between an adult child and their parents is complex, and it's often affected by things like gender roles and major life events like divorce. Most of the time, women, especially girls, are at the center of these family relationships. They often become "kin keepers" and build stronger relationships, especially with their moms (Lye, 1996; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1997). This difference between men and women shows how important it is for women to keep family ties strong. On the other hand, when parents split up, it can make these ties more difficult than they need to be, especially between dads and their adult children. Divorce, on the other hand, means fewer visits, less emotional closeness, and more physical distance, all of which hurt the relationship between the father and the kid (Booth & Amato, 1994; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1997). A parent's bond with their children doesn't have to be worse when the parent is separated. It is important to remember that parental divorce can hurt these relationships in different ways based on when the divorce happened (while the kids were still at home or after they left). This shows how complicated the factors are that affect how adult children and their parents interact with each other.

                <h2>The Role of Grandparents in Extended Families </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Grandparents' roles in extended families have changed a lot, and they are becoming more and more important in today's families. People are living longer and healthier lives thanks to improvements in healthcare and higher life expectancy. This means that grandparents can be more involved in their grandchildren's lives for longer amounts of time. At the same time that this change happened, there was a cultural shift toward smaller families. This made the grandmother's part more important. Unlike in the past, when many generations lived in the same house, grandparents today usually don't have to deal with this problem. This is because big families made it hard to tell the difference between parenting and grandparenting. It is normal for them to become grandmothers after they are done being parents. Having this freedom lets them spend more time and money on their grandchildren. A study by Silverstein and Marenco (2001) shows that most grandparents in the US think their role is very important. This shows that grandparents are more involved. There are also a lot of grandparents who talk to their grandkids often and have a close emotional connection with them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to help their grandkids grow emotionally and socially, grandparents do a lot of different things. They watch over their grandchildren, provide guidance, and be people the grandchildren can talk to. People like President Boyd K. Packer, who talked about how important it is for young people to connect with their elders, have brought attention to how important it is for grandkids to stay in touch with their grandparents. The grandkids will live longer if they have these interactions. Researchers have found that being close to grandparents can help grandkids who are having behavior problems or depressive symptoms (Henderson, Hayslip, Sanders, & Louden, 2009; Ruiz & Silverstein, 2007). These kinds of interactions are very helpful, and studies have shown that being close to grandparents emotionally can lessen these symptoms in grandkids. Also, Attar-Schwartz, Tan, Buchanan, Flouri, and Griggs (2009) discovered that grandkids who spend time with their grandparents are more likely to behave in a kind way. This benefit is especially clear in African American families and homes with only one parent. These results make it clear how important grandparents are to the structure of extended families. They also show how important grandparents are in promoting the health and moral growth of future generations.

                <h2>Extended Family Support: Help from the Grandparent Generation</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    
                    Gran grandparents offer their adult children and grandkids a unique mix of emotional support, advice, and practical help. This is one of the most important ways that grandparents help their extended families. Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, and Zarit (2009) say that their involvement can range from giving occasional help, like babysitting, to taking on more important social and advice roles. These writers stress how important it is for grandparents to be there for and support their grandchildren emotionally. These kinds of help between generations are becoming more and more important in today's society, where the difficulties of modern life often require more family support. Granny is called "the Family National Guard" by Hagestad (1985), and Elder Neal A. Maxwell agrees, calling grandparents the "strategic reserve" of the family (1997, p. 146). When their grandkids are in trouble, grandparents help them. They are skilled at going from being an unobtrusive presence to an active part in their families' lives, offering real help during times of crisis like illness, unemployment, or divorce, demonstrating a strong support system that forms the basis of the family structure.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More and more grandparents are taking on a more permanent role as main caregivers or custodial grandparents. This shows how the dynamics of extended families are changing. This is in addition to giving help from time to time. Landry-Meyer, Gerard, and Guzell (2005) say that the rising number of grandparents who raise their grandchildren is a sign of a change in society. Hayslip and Kaminski (2005) say that about 2.4 million grandparents have taken on the duty of taking care of their grandchildren. Given that this role reversal often happens when parents are unable to care for their grandkids because of problems with drugs or alcohol or because they are sick, it shows how dedicated grandparents are to their duties as caregivers for their grandchildren. According to academics like Hayslip and Kaminski (2005), there is a chance of more stress and health problems. However, the organization of custodial care has a lot of big benefits, such as helping grandkids do better in school and with their friends. Grannies and grandmas are very important in large families because they keep things stable and, in many cases, offer a chance for the next generation to learn and grow. This difficult mix of giving up things and being happy shows how important grandparents are to extended families.

                <h2>Extended Family Support: Help for the Elderly </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    
                    The support system that occurs in extended families, especially for the elderly, shows how important it is for people of different generations to help each other. This is because the amount of care that goes back and forth between adult children and their elderly parents changes a lot over time. At first, this relationship was based on mutual support. But as parents get older and have health problems that make it harder for them to care for themselves, something changes. In their study from 2006, Van Gallen and Dykstra talk about how emotional and physical help is passed down from one generation to the next. When the parents' health starts to get worse, this care is put to the test. According to Pinquart and Sorensen (2003), longer times of illness and longer life expectancy make the need for elder care greater. This shows how important it is for families to take care of their elderly members. Elder Dallin H. Oaks (1991) and President Ezra Taft Benson (1989) are two LDS Church leaders who have said again that we should respect and care for our elderly parents as the Bible says. They have also talked about how important it is for older people who are less independent to have help from family, church, and society. The idea that the family is the best place to get help for older family members is supported by this care framework, which not only follows moral and ethical rules but also meets the actual needs of older family members.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though it shows how strong and devoted the family is, caring for others is usually done by adult children, especially girls. But there are some problems that come with this heavy duty. The results of studies by Pinquart and Sorensen (2003) and Wolff and Kasper (2006) show that a lot of the care that crippled older people get is given by their family members. About thirty hours a week are spent on this task by these family members, and some of them give even more. The responsibilities of caring for an elderly person, their physical and mental limitations, and the chance of behavioral disorders can all make the caregiver very stressed, depressed, and sick. Even though this job is rewarding, it causes a lot of stress, depression, and health problems for the caregiver. The caregiver's health is also affected by how the family works, especially how sisterly or brotherly love or dislike them. According to Suitor and Pillemer (1993) and Strawbridge and Wallhagen (1991), this can have a big effect on how stressed people are and how decisions about care are made. Because of this, Elder Oaks and President Benson pushed for siblings to work together and for the main caregiver's hard work to be recognized. This has to be done so that the caregiver and the person receiving care can share the good and bad parts of caring for an elderly person. This way, the caregiver will be supported and there will be fewer arguments that could hurt the person receiving care.

           <!-- <li style="margin-top: 1em;">The scripture 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 emphasizes the role of physical intimacy within the marital relationship to prevent the temptation of fornication. The passage instructs that for a man and woman to avoid sexual immorality, they should enter into the commitment of marriage. It underscores the mutual responsibility of spouses toward each other's physical needs, emphasizing the concept of rendering due benevolence. This implies that both husband and wife have a shared obligation to fulfill each other's physical desires within the bounds of the marital relationship. The scriptural message also highlights the idea that, within marriage, the husband and wife do not have sole ownership of their bodies but share this intimacy exclusively with each other. The temporary withholding of physical intimacy for fasting and prayer is allowed with mutual consent, but the emphasis is on the importance of coming together again to prevent succumbing to the temptations of Satan due to a lack of self-control. In summary, this scripture underscores the significance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital relationship, portraying it as a means to fulfill each other's needs and strengthen the bond between spouses while guarding against immoral temptations.</li>

                The concept of physical attraction is intricately interwoven with the teachings on intimacy within the context of marriage, as elucidated in the doctrinal perspectives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The teachings emphasize that tenderness and respect should be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife, asserting that the sacred powers of procreation are divinely appointed and are to be employed only within the bounds of a lawful marriage. This perspective is rooted in the belief that physical intimacy is not only a means of fulfilling the divine commandment to multiply and replenish the earth but is also an essential component of the love-inspired companionship between a man and a woman, promoting the development of higher faculties and nobler traits of human nature..</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    According to the teachings, the proper exercise of physical intimacy within the marital relationship is viewed as a sanctification of innate desires and sympathies, leading to life, happiness, and exaltation. The doctrine underscores that physical intimacy, when approached within the sacred covenant of marriage, is not merely a plaything or a means of satisfying passions and lusts but is a righteous and divinely approved expression of love. The emphasis extends beyond the physical aspect, highlighting the spiritual and emotional dimensions of love and affection. The teachings stress that true love transcends mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, understanding, unselfishness, sacrifice, and companionship with common ideals and standards.</li>

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> However, these teachings also emphasize the importance of maintaining the sanctity of physical intimacy within the boundaries set by God. Any sexual intimacy outside the bonds of marriage is considered a violation of divine commandments. The doctrines caution against misusing physical intimacy and underscore the need for cleanliness of thought and action within the intimate relationship between husband and wife. Thus, within the doctrinal framework of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, physical attraction is intricately connected to love and affection, and its proper expression is viewed as a sacred and divinely approved manifestation of marital intimacy.

                    Consider the case of Sarah and Mark in the image above, a married couple who adhere to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their relationship exemplifies the importance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital bond. Sarah and Mark prioritize tenderness, respect, and the sanctity of physical intimacy, adhering to the principles outlined in their faith. Their love goes beyond mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, and a deep understanding of each other. By approaching physical intimacy as a sacred and divinely approved expression of their commitment, Sarah and Mark strengthen their marital bond, fostering a sense of companionship rooted in common ideals and standards. This real-life example underscores how the principles of physical attraction within the framework of their faith contribute to the overall health and vitality of their marital relationship.
