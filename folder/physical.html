    <h3>Supporting Families across Generations<hr></h3>

    <div class="container">
        <div style="color: lightgrey;">
        
                <h2>Relationships between Adult Children and their Parents </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Researchers studying families have been looking at how adult children interact with their parents. 
                    This has made people question the idea that changes in society would lead to fewer interactions between 
                    the two generations. As people moved from the country to the cities in the early 1900s, experts predicted 
                    that family unity would weaken. They were afraid that adult children would grow apart from their parents 
                    when they had to move to towns for work and family reasons. This idea, which was summed up by Talcott 
                    Parsons' "isolated nuclear family" (1943), showed that ties between generations were not likely to get 
                    better in the future. Empirical studies, on the other hand, have shown that this myth is not true because 
                    many adult children still have close ties with their parents. Lye (1996) says that a large portion of 
                    adult children visit their parents regularly and maintain a strong emotional bond with them throughout 
                    their lives. Lawton, Silverstein, and Bengtson's (1994a) study shows that more than two-thirds of adult 
                    children talk to their parents at least once a week, if not every day. It seems likely that more than 
                    half of adult children live within an hour's drive of their parents based on this result. In addition, 
                    most people feel very close to their family members emotionally, which shows how strong these bonds are 
                    ("Lye, 1996").
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Many things, like gender roles and big life events like death or divorce, can change the 
                    relationship between an adult child and their parents. Most of the time, these family ties 
                    are centered around women, especially young girls. Lye (1996) and Silverstein and Bengtson 
                    (1997) say that they often act as "kin keepers" and are able to get along better with their 
                    dads and moms. This difference between men and women shows how important it is for women to 
                    stay close to their families. It can be harder for these bonds to stay strong after a divorce, 
                    especially between dads and their grown children. This is really true when the dads aren't together. 
                    Both Booth and Amato (1994) and Silverstein and Bengtson (1997) say that when a parent gets separated, 
                    the child and father live farther away from each other and spend less time together. All of these 
                    things hurt the bond between the dad and the kid. When a parent separates from their kids, things 
                    don't have to get worse. Remember that a parent's divorce can affect these ties in both good and bad 
                    ways, depending on when it happened (while the kids were still at home or after they left). And this 
                    shows how difficult these changes are that make it hard for parents and grown children to talk to each 
                    other.

                <h2>The Role of Grandparents in Extended Families </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    Grandparents play a bigger and bigger part in today's homes than they did in the past. 
                    As healthcare gets better and life expectancy rises, people live longer and happier lives.
                     Grandparents can be more active in their grandchildren's lives for longer periods of time. 
                     In the same time period as this change, families became smaller in popular culture. This meant 
                     that the grandmother's part was more significant. Unlike in the past, when many families lived 
                     in one house, grandparents today don't have to deal with this issue very often. These differences 
                     happened because it was tough to tell the difference between being a parent and a grandparent in 
                     large families. After being parents, it's normal for them to become grandma. Now that they are free, 
                     they can spend more time and money on their grandkids. A study by Silverstein and Marenco (2001) shows 
                     that most grandparents in the US think their role is very important. The grandparents are more active. 
                     Numerous grandparents also spend a lot of time talking and getting close to their grandchildren.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to help their grandchildren grow as people, grandparents do many things. As grandparents, 
                    they look out for their grandkids, teach them, and give them someone to talk to. A lot of people, 
                    including President Boyd K. Packer, have talked about how important it is for kids to stay in touch 
                    with their grandparents. The grandchildren will live longer if they spend time with their grandparents. 
                    Having close grandparents can help grandchildren who are having behavior issues or signs of depression 
                    (Henderson, Hayslip, Sanders, & Louden, 2009; Ruiz & Silverstein, 2007). These kinds of interactions are 
                    very helpful, and has shown that grandchildren who are mentally close to their grandparents are less 
                    likely to have these symptoms. A study by Attar-Schwartz, Tan, Buchanan, Flouri, and Griggs (2009) also 
                    found that grandchildren who spend time with their grandparents are more likely to be respectful. This 
                    effect is very clear in homes with only one parent or African American parents. The author prove the 
                    important grandparents are to the foundation of big families. Besides that, they show how important 
                    grandparents are for helping kids grow up healthy and mature.

                <h2>Extended Family Support: Help from the Grandparent Generation</h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    
                    When grandparents have grown children or grandchildren, they offer a unique mix of emotional support, 
                    advice, and physical help. One of the most important things grandparents do to help their large families 
                    is this. Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, and Zarit (2009) say that their involvement can range from helping 
                    out once in a while, like babysitting, to playing more important parts in socializing and giving advice. 
                    It is very important for grandparents to be there for and help their grandkids, as the authors say. These 
                    kinds of help between generations are growing more and more important in today's world, where life's 
                    problems often call for more family support. And Elder Neal A. Maxwell agrees, calling grandparents the 
                    "strategic reserve" of the family (1997, p. 146), and Hagestad calls Granny "the Family National Guard" 
                    (1985). Grandparents help their grandchildren when they are in trouble. They know how to change from being 
                    an unobtrusive presence to an active part in their families' lives. They offer real help during times of 
                    trouble like illness, unemployment, or divorce, showing that the family has a strong support through generations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    More and more grandparents are taking on a more permanent role as main caregivers or custodial 
                    grandparents. This shows how the dynamics of extended families are changing. This is in addition 
                    to giving help from time to time. Landry-Meyer, Gerard, and Guzell (2005) say that the rising 
                    number of grandparents who raise their grandchildren is a sign of a change in society. Hayslip 
                    and Kaminski (2005) say that about 2.4 million grandparents have taken on the duty of taking care 
                    of their grandchildren. Given that this role reversal often happens when parents are unable to 
                    care for their grandkids because of problems with drugs or alcohol or because they are sick, it 
                    shows how dedicated grandparents are to their duties as caregivers for their grandchildren. According 
                    to academics like Hayslip and Kaminski (2005), there is a chance of more stress and health problems. 
                    However, the organization of custodial care has a lot of big benefits, such as helping grandkids do 
                    better in school and with their friends. Grannies and grandmas are very important in large families 
                    because they keep things stable and, in many cases, offer a chance for the next generation to learn 
                    and grow. This difficult mix of giving up things and being happy shows how important grandparents are 
                    to extended families.

                <h2>Extended Family Support: Help for the Elderly </h2>
                <p style="margin-top: 1em;">
                    
                    The support roles that occurs in extended families, especially for the elderly, shows how important 
                    it is for people of different generations to help each other out. This is because the amount of care that 
                    goes back and forth between adult children and their elderly parents changes a lot over time. At first, 
                    this relationship was based on mutual support. But as parents get older and have health problems that 
                    make it harder for them to care for themselves, something changes. In their study from 2006, Van Gallen 
                    and Dykstra talk about how emotional and physical help is passed down from one generation to the next. 
                    When the parents' health starts to get worse, this care is put to the test. According to Pinquart and 
                    Sorensen (2003), longer times of illness and longer life expectancy make the need for elder care greater. 
                    This shows how important it is for families to take care of their elderly members. Elder Dallin H. Oaks 
                    (1991) and President Ezra Taft Benson (1989) are two LDS Church leaders who have said again that we should 
                    respect and care for our elderly parents as the Bible says. They have also talked about how important it 
                    is for older people who are less independent to have help from family, church, and society. The idea that 
                    the family is the best place to get help for older family members is supported by this care framework, 
                    which not only follows moral and ethical rules but also meets the actual needs of older family members.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even though it shows how strong and devoted the family is, caring for others is usually done by adult 
                    children, especially girls. But there are some problems that come with this heavy duty. The results of 
                    studies by Pinquart and Sorensen (2003) and Wolff and Kasper (2006) show that a lot of the care that 
                    crippled older people get is given by their family members. About thirty hours a week are spent on 
                    this task by these family members, and some of them give even more. The responsibilities of caring 
                    for an elderly person, their physical and mental limitations, and the chance of behavioral disorders 
                    can all make the caregiver very stressed, depressed, and sick. Even though this job is rewarding, it 
                    causes a lot of stress, depression, and health problems for the caregiver. The caregiver's health is
                     also affected by how the family works, especially how sisterly or brotherly love or dislike them.
                      According to Suitor and Pillemer (1993) and Strawbridge and Wallhagen (1991), this can have a big 
                      effect on how stressed people are and how decisions about care are made. Because of this, Elder Oaks 
                      and President Benson pushed for siblings to work together and for the main caregiver's hard work to 
                      be recognized. This has to be done so that the caregiver and the person receiving care can share the 
                      good and bad parts of caring for an elderly person. This way, the caregiver will be supported and 
                      there will be fewer arguments that could hurt the person receiving care.

           <!-- <li style="margin-top: 1em;">The scripture 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 emphasizes the role of physical intimacy within the marital relationship to prevent the temptation of fornication. The passage instructs that for a man and woman to avoid sexual immorality, they should enter into the commitment of marriage. It underscores the mutual responsibility of spouses toward each other's physical needs, emphasizing the concept of rendering due benevolence. This implies that both husband and wife have a shared obligation to fulfill each other's physical desires within the bounds of the marital relationship. The scriptural message also highlights the idea that, within marriage, the husband and wife do not have sole ownership of their bodies but share this intimacy exclusively with each other. The temporary withholding of physical intimacy for fasting and prayer is allowed with mutual consent, but the emphasis is on the importance of coming together again to prevent succumbing to the temptations of Satan due to a lack of self-control. In summary, this scripture underscores the significance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital relationship, portraying it as a means to fulfill each other's needs and strengthen the bond between spouses while guarding against immoral temptations.</li>

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    
                The concept of physical attraction is intricately interwoven with the teachings on intimacy within the context of marriage, as elucidated in the doctrinal perspectives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The teachings emphasize that tenderness and respect should be the guiding principles in the intimate relationship between husband and wife, asserting that the sacred powers of procreation are divinely appointed and are to be employed only within the bounds of a lawful marriage. This perspective is rooted in the belief that physical intimacy is not only a means of fulfilling the divine commandment to multiply and replenish the earth but is also an essential component of the love-inspired companionship between a man and a woman, promoting the development of higher faculties and nobler traits of human nature..</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    According to the teachings, the proper exercise of physical intimacy within the marital relationship is viewed as a sanctification of innate desires and sympathies, leading to life, happiness, and exaltation. The doctrine underscores that physical intimacy, when approached within the sacred covenant of marriage, is not merely a plaything or a means of satisfying passions and lusts but is a righteous and divinely approved expression of love. The emphasis extends beyond the physical aspect, highlighting the spiritual and emotional dimensions of love and affection. The teachings stress that true love transcends mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, understanding, unselfishness, sacrifice, and companionship with common ideals and standards.</li>

                <li style="margin-top: 2em;"> However, these teachings also emphasize the importance of maintaining the sanctity of physical intimacy within the boundaries set by God. Any sexual intimacy outside the bonds of marriage is considered a violation of divine commandments. The doctrines caution against misusing physical intimacy and underscore the need for cleanliness of thought and action within the intimate relationship between husband and wife. Thus, within the doctrinal framework of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, physical attraction is intricately connected to love and affection, and its proper expression is viewed as a sacred and divinely approved manifestation of marital intimacy.

                    Consider the case of Sarah and Mark in the image above, a married couple who adhere to the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Their relationship exemplifies the importance of physical attraction within the context of a committed marital bond. Sarah and Mark prioritize tenderness, respect, and the sanctity of physical intimacy, adhering to the principles outlined in their faith. Their love goes beyond mere physical attraction, encompassing faith, confidence, and a deep understanding of each other. By approaching physical intimacy as a sacred and divinely approved expression of their commitment, Sarah and Mark strengthen their marital bond, fostering a sense of companionship rooted in common ideals and standards. This real-life example underscores how the principles of physical attraction within the framework of their faith contribute to the overall health and vitality of their marital relationship.

This will help both partners feel safe and comfortable in expressing their love for one another.

                    When creating a plan for incorporating physical affection into your relationship, both parties should discuss their needs and expectations. This will help them set boundaries and ensure that physical affection is being used to benefit the relationship. Once these expectations are established, couples can devise a plan for incorporating physical affection into their relationship. This could include making time for regular physical contact or coming up with ideas for creative and special ways to show love.
