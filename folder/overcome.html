        <h2>Financial Disagreements</h2>
        <p style="margin: 1em;">
            
           This chapter has provide so much benefits of being married. Regarding financial issues, 
           “Committed couples hunker down and stay the course together,” and
            “Although they may experience pain, they may also know the great joy of overcoming challenges
            and loss together” (Stanley, 2005, p. 200). This quote says that couples need not go straight to the
            conclusion of getting a divorce or separation. Still, they need open communication about sharing
            equal thoughts and opinions in their rooms, to find ways to solve financial issues or any other
            problems. Experiencing pain can help couples think about sharpening their decision-making
            according to the problem. This chapter mentioned that married adults are healthier than non-married 
            adults and they have a lot of benefits like they will have low rates of morbidity and mortality
            and their health status persist like couples will bond together and fix past and future problems
            (Hawkwin, ch7, p.71). Economist has reported that “Married couples, even those with lower
            incomes, report greater financial security and, as a result, have greater access to better housing,
            food, and services like health care than the never-married, divorced, or widowed” (Stack &amp;
            Eshleman, 1998). This means that couples with equally shared values, opinions, and open
            communication can achieve benefits that were mentioned by the Economist.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the gospel library, I came across a researcher about an <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2016/07/young-adults/an-eternal-perspective-on-personal-and-family-finance?lang=eng"
            style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank">Eternal perspective on personal and family
            finance (Sudweeks &amp; Hill, 2016)</a>. I found some of the spiritual and physical solutions that couples
            should stay together and discuss to avoid this kind of financial issue. Firstly, pay the Lord first in
            tithes and offerings. Paying the Lord's tithes and offerings will bless us. In Malachi 3:10, it says that
            God will open the windows of heaven, and pour blessings to those who pay tithes and fast offerings.
            Secondly, create and use a budget for monthly planning. Couples should have financial plans and
            goals like tithing, investments, food, housing, clothing, insurance, medical expenses, and cars. And
            other annual expenses like Christmas, vacations, and family matters. Having these would also help
            couples to examine to not spend too much on useless things. Last but not least, avoid debts, if you
            have debts you need to follow the debt elimination plan below to avoid debts. President Gordon B.
            Hinckley (191-2008) urged Church members: “Be modest in your expenditures; discipline
            yourselves in your purchases to avoid debt to the extent possible. Pay off debt as quickly as you can,
            and free yourselves from bondage.”

        <h2>Childcare Issues</h2>
        <p style="margin: 1em;">
            In this chapter it shared a significant advantages of marriage offers in the realm of child-rearing. 
            A stable marriage like parents honoring marriage vow, having equally partnership, good parenting, 
            support family goals, and provide for their children. Benefit of marriage, let couple experience 
            the parenting role which is one most key point for this issue. Hawkwins and VanDenBerghe ephasize that 
            "A stable marriage corresponded with happiness, health, prosperity, and well-being of offspring and 
            communities" (VanDenBerghe & Hawkin, p.71). Having supportive parents could help the children follow 
            the same example as their parent's parenting them. Such as supporting in shared responsability and mutual 
            support equitably in family could help to build a great environment for raising children, in the proclamation
            "benefits of Married couples' children, whether black, white, or Hispanic, enjoy better physical health and 
            longevity. The causes lie in better education, healthier behaviors, and more stable economic 
            conditions associated with marriage" (VanDenBerghe & Hawkin, p.74), this quote said that parents need to have 
            better education, and financial management could help them to provide for their children. Benefits in marriage 
            reduce depressive in both men and women mental health and help couples to 
            having support to the theory that marriage is associated with well-being and happy feelings. Being 
            divorce through unequal responsability affects the children development and as a bad example to them, because 
            they will likely do the same thing as they grow up. This chapter said that "people enter and exit marriage 
            affects human behavior such as smoking, diet, exercise, and access to health care" (VanDenBerghe & Hawkin, p.74). These
            affections will also be on childrens, because when parents separates, the parenting role will not be fully established 
            in family.
            <br>
            <br>

            In the Mother as Nurturer (Erickson, ch12, p.136), not only mother but father must spend so much time with 
            their young children like age 1-4. "importance of mothers spending time with their children, but they also indicate 
            that it is the way a mother interacts with her children when she is with them that is most important" and "further, 
            childcare that was more like a nurturing home than a childcare center, with a higher adult-to-child ratio that 
            allowed children to receive consistent, responsive nurturing, was not associated with negative effects over 
            the long term" (Erickson, p.137). Therefore, parents must actively need to spend much time with their children as 
            they're in child-to-adult by giving them attentions, talk to them in lower voice as a great parenting, 
            solve their problems, support their education, and keep nurturing them till they become adult and be self-reliance.
            “When a child is born to a husband and wife, they are fulfilling part of our Heavenly Father's plan to 
            bring children to earth,” <a style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/prophets-and-apostles/unto-all-the-world/todays-family-we-believe-in-children?lang=eng#:~:text=Part%20of%20Heavenly%20Father's%20Plan,and%20eternal%20life%20of%20man.">
            Elder Andersen said.</a> In <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng"
            style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank">Moses 1:39 </a>The Lord said, "This is my work and my glory—to bring 
            to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." Therefore, children in God's view, is part of his plan of happiness. Parents'
            need to take care of them till they have their own.

        <h2>Lack of communication</h2>
        <p style="margin: 1em;">
            In order to improve couples marriage and family life, couples must need to overcome lack of 
            communication (Chapter 7 of "The Warm, Happy Marriage: Cold, Hard Facts to Consider"). 
            "The cornerstone of a strong marriage is not just communication, but the right kind of 
            communication" (VanDenBerghe & Hawkins, 2023, p. 73). Communication is not something that we think 
            lighter on during couples discussion. Hawkwins said, couple need have a deeply conversation, 
            like including honest, openess, express emotions, empathy, willing to provide ideas, and focus. All these 
            aspects will help them to fix the childcare and financial issues and other different kind problems to build their 
            relationship everlasting and make great environment in their home.

            <br>
            I will like to share a story about a husband and a wife miscommunication. 
            So one night they got into a fight, which leading them not to talk 
            with one another silence in long period of time in that night. Even when they prepare for bed. The husband was 
            worried that he need someone to wake him up early morning (6.00am), to catch an early job interview
            around 8.00am. Therefore, he wrote a letter and stick it on her wife's pillow. Please wake me up around 6:00am.
            When the husband woke up and he look at the time it's 9.00am in the morning. He was mad and angry and about to 
            have an another argument with her. As he looks at his wife's pillow, to see if the note is still there. He saw a respond 
            of his wife on the note, get up! it's 6.00am. Therefore, this story shows the lack of communication that led him 
            missed his job interview. Always remember that "It is important to fixed the 
            problem right away rather than procrastinate it."
