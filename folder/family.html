          <p >
            I am so greatful for this course that help me to deepening my understanding in achieving happy family. One
            quote that I read through the family proclamation that helps me and my family is "successful marriages and 
            families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, 
            compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. (The Family Proclamation)" During this course, I was able to share my family 
            about these principles that help us to enhance our relationships with one another and also to bring happiness in our 
            family. In the link happiness in family, it emphasize all the principles above and our church leader's quotes that 
            help us to firm our testimony about the teachings of the gospel. In this site, it talks about different kinds of 
            aspects that can help family to build their relationships stronger such as, working together, support each other, 
            open communication, empathy, and etc. These aspects can solve family problems and make new generation stay on the 
            right path of building happy marriage and family. I am so grateful to born in a family that active to the church, and 
            also born here in Samoa. Samoa culture has give a lot of good impact towards children and parents. For example, 
            here in Samoa Younger people are expected to defer to their elders and those of higher status than them, 
            such as the Matai. Children are taught from a young age to respect their elders, avoid shaming their family 
            and to sustain certain aspects of tradition. From the age of five, children are expected to play an active 
            role in the family. Samoans will often use the same word to refer to their father and uncles (tamā) as well 
            as for their mother and aunts (tinā). This reflects the close relationship one may have with extended family.
            As Latter-Day Saints we know that we can be with our family forever. It is part of God’s plan of happiness 
            for His children. By accomplished this God's plan of happiness, we need to keep the commandments, 
            follow Him in faith, and endure to the end we have the joy of knowing that our family will always be together.

    In the image above, that when show our appreciation and gratitude to my sister and cousins on their graduation. This 
    shows supportive, valued they are in our family. That celebration help my extended family to gather together and celebrate 
    the accomplishment of my older sister and my cousin. This include my Parent, Grand-mothers', aunt, uncle, cousins, and my siblings
    as well. This get together helped us to catch up with one another due to busyness of our work, school, and daily life doings.
    Me and my extended familiy had a great time and reminds me of my Grand-mothers, they said, said that there is no place 
    like home. This means that home is the only place we can find true happiness.

    During this course the family, I have teached my family about ways to strengthen our family. We dicussed how faith, prayer,
    forgiveness, repentance, love, compassion, work, and activities can help us build our family much more firmer.
    "Fear is the opposite of faith. We move forward, certain that the Lord will watch over us, particularly in the family (Elder Boyd K. Packer)"
    This quote said that we should always have faith in God, because no matter where we go, God will watch over us and our family. 
    "A stronger personal faith in Jesus Christ will prepare [your children] for the challenges they will most surely face (Elder Andersen)."
    As we have faith in God, we will help us to overcome many challenges we face. Especially couples and families. Make our 
    home a place where individuals can pray. Just like we want our kids to come to us for help and support, our Heavenly 
    Father wants us to come to Him. "Always pray and believe," (D&C 90:24). When our kids pray with us on their knees and 
    listen to us beg for them, they learn how to pray. We all know that people we love the most are our families. 
    Even though, sometimes we hurt each other's feelings, offend them, or even break our promises. To rebuild our 
    relationship again we must think about repentance. To heal, be happy, and find peace in your marriage and family, 
    say "I'm sorry" and try to do better. When our family experience any broken relationship due to the wrong doings, we 
    should forgive them to maintain our bond with them. In D&C 64:10, Jesus said, “I, the Lord, will forgive 
    whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men” (D&C 64:10). When we forgive each other, our homes 
    will be filled with comfort and sweet peace. Showing love one another in our family will bring joy and happiness to us. 
    “Love one another; as I have loved you” (John 13:34). This quote help to bring success to every marriage 
    and family. In the light of Christ’s love we see our family’s divine potential. We love them with all our heart,
     soul, and mind. And as we do, our ordinary family is transformed into an extraordinary one. We can find love, 
     kindness, and warmth in our homes, even when life comes hard. We feel safe if someone in our family understand 
     and cares how we feel. This can lead us to see and feel the kindness at our home which makes us want to show more 
     kindness to others. Building a strong family takes hard work, and part of that work is teaching our 
     children how to work. Though some may see work as something to avoid, the gospel teaches that working 
     for and with our families brings great blessings. God Himself calls His plan for His children “my work 
     and my glory” (Moses 1:39). When Families plays together stays together, especially when their play is uplifting 
     and wholesome. Family vacations, holidays, birthday celebrations, and other activities build strong bonds and 
     feelings of self-worth. The phrase “Remember when we…” is sure to bring love and laughter in the years to come.

    To strengthen family bonds and create a nurturing environment, it's crucial to implement strategies that foster communication, respect, and understanding. Here’s a summary of effective ways to achieve this, along with examples:
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Quality Time Together:</strong> Make it a priority to spend quality time with family members regularly. This could be through family meals, game nights, or outdoor activities. For instance, scheduling a weekly movie night where every member gets to pick the movie on rotation can create anticipation and joy.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Open Communication:</strong> Encourage open and honest communication within the family. Create a safe space where everyone feels comfortable expressing their feelings and thoughts without fear of judgment. An example could be having a "family meeting" once a week where each person shares something they're grateful for and something they're struggling with.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Establish Traditions:</strong> Building family traditions can create a sense of belonging and identity. This might include holiday rituals, birthday celebrations, or even a Saturday morning pancake breakfast. These traditions become cherished memories and strengthen family ties.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Show Appreciation and Affection:</strong> Regularly express love and appreciation for each family member. This can be through verbal affirmations, notes of appreciation, or physical gestures like hugs. An example would be leaving encouraging notes in your child’s lunchbox or on the bathroom mirror for your spouse.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Teach and Model Respect:</strong> Demonstrate respect in how you treat each other within the family. This includes listening attentively, acknowledging feelings, and showing consideration for each other’s opinions and needs. For instance, involving children in decision-making processes on matters that affect them teaches respect and mutual consideration.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Shared Responsibilities:</strong> Involve all family members in household duties to foster a sense of responsibility and teamwork. Assigning age-appropriate chores, and perhaps rotating them, can make everyone feel they're contributing to the family’s well-being. For example, even young children can help set the table or feed a pet.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Support Individual Interests:</strong> While family time is important, supporting individual interests and activities is equally vital. Encourage each family member to pursue their hobbies and passions, and show interest in their pursuits. Attending your child’s sports game or music recital, for example, demonstrates support for their individuality.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Deal with Conflicts Constructively:</strong> Address conflicts openly but respectfully, aiming for resolution rather than blame. Teaching conflict resolution skills, such as active listening and expressing one’s feelings without attacking the other, can help. Role-playing conflict scenarios and discussing possible solutions can be an effective way to prepare for real-life disagreements.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Foster a Positive Home Environment:</strong> Strive to make your home a place of positivity, safety, and support. This includes limiting negative influences, such as excessive screen time or harmful media content, and promoting activities that enrich the mind and spirit, like reading or family discussions on various topics.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Seek External Support When Needed:</strong> Recognize when the family might benefit from external support, whether it’s counseling, community resources, or spiritual guidance. For example, engaging in family counseling sessions can help address underlying issues and improve dynamics.
