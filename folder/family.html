          " target="_blank">Happiness in Family >></a></h2>
          <p >
            I am so greatful for this course that help me to deepening my understanding in achieving happy family. One
            quote that I read through the family proclamation that helps me and my family is "successful marriages and 
            families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, 
            compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. (The Family Proclamation)" During this course, I was able to share my family 
            about these principles that help us to enhance our relationships with one another and also to bring happiness in our 
            family. In the link happiness in family, it emphasize all the principles above and our church leader's quotes that 
            help us to firm our testimony about the teachings of the gospel. In this site, it talks about different kinds of 
            aspects that can help family to build their relationships stronger such as, working together, support each other, 
            open communication, empathy, and etc. These aspects can solve family problems and make new generation stay on the 
            right path of building happy marriage and family. I am so grateful to born in a family that active to the church, and 
            also born here in Samoa. Samoa culture has give a lot of good impact towards children and parents. For example, 
            here in Samoa Younger people are expected to defer to their elders and those of higher status than them, 
            such as the Matai. Children are taught from a young age to respect their elders, avoid shaming their family 
            and to sustain certain aspects of tradition. From the age of five, children are expected to play an active 
            role in the family. Samoans will often use the same word to refer to their father and uncles (tamā) as well 
            as for their mother and aunts (tinā). This reflects the close relationship one may have with extended family.
            As Latter-Day Saints we know that we can be with our family forever. It is part of God’s plan of happiness 
            for His children. By accomplished this God's plan of happiness, we need to keep the commandments, 
            follow Him in faith, and endure to the end we have the joy of knowing that our family will always be together.

    In the image above, that when show our appreciation and gratitude to my sister and cousins on their graduation. This 
    shows supportive, valued they are in our family. That celebration help my extended family to gather together and celebrate 
    the accomplishment of my older sister and my cousin. This include my Parent, Grand-mothers', aunt, uncle, cousins, and my siblings
    as well. This get together helped us to catch up with one another due to busyness of our work, school, and daily life doings.
    Me and my extended familiy had a great time and reminds me of my Grand-mothers, they said, said that there is no place 
    like home. This means that home is the only place we can find true happiness. 
    <br>
    <br>
    During this course the family, I have teached my family about ways to strengthen our family. We dicussed how faith, prayer,
    forgiveness, repentance, love, compassion, work, and activities can help us build our family much more firmer.
    "Fear is the opposite of faith. We move forward, certain that the Lord will watch over us, particularly in the family (Elder Boyd K. Packer)"
    This quote said that we should always have faith in God, because no matter where we go, God will watch over us and our family. 
    "A stronger personal faith in Jesus Christ will prepare [your children] for the challenges they will most surely face (Elder Andersen)."
    As we have faith in God, we will help us to overcome many challenges we face. Especially couples and families. Make our 
    home a place where individuals can pray. Just like we want our kids to come to us for help and support, our Heavenly 
    Father wants us to come to Him. "Always pray and believe," (D&C 90:24). When our kids pray with us on their knees and 
    listen to us beg for them, they learn how to pray. We all know that people we love the most are our families. 
    Even though, sometimes we hurt each other's feelings, offend them, or even break our promises. To rebuild our 
    relationship again we must think about repentance. To heal, be happy, and find peace in your marriage and family, 
    say "I'm sorry" and try to do better. When our family experience any broken relationship due to the wrong doings, we 
    should forgive them to maintain our bond with them. In D&C 64:10, Jesus said, “I, the Lord, will forgive 
    whom I will forgive, but of you it is required to forgive all men” (D&C 64:10). When we forgive each other, our homes 
    will be filled with comfort and sweet peace. Showing love one another in our family will bring joy and happiness to us. 
    “Love one another; as I have loved you” (John 13:34). This quote help to bring success to every marriage 
    and family. In the light of Christ’s love we see our family’s divine potential. We love them with all our heart,
     soul, and mind. And as we do, our ordinary family is transformed into an extraordinary one. We can find love, 
     kindness, and warmth in our homes, even when life comes hard. We feel safe if someone in our family understand 
     and cares how we feel. This can lead us to see and feel the kindness at our home which makes us want to show more 
     kindness to others. Building a strong family takes hard work, and part of that work is teaching our 
     children how to work. Though some may see work as something to avoid, the gospel teaches that working 
     for and with our families brings great blessings. God Himself calls His plan for His children “my work 
     and my glory” (Moses 1:39). When Families plays together stays together, especially when their play is uplifting 
     and wholesome. Family vacations, holidays, birthday celebrations, and other activities build strong bonds and 
     feelings of self-worth. The phrase “Remember when we…” is sure to bring love and laughter in the years to come.

  <div class="container"><p>
    This website by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint. It provides helpful informations about strengthening the family.
    To view the website click the heading.
    It covers some the great facts I listed below:
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>1. Parenting Principles and Practices:</strong> Many children experience problems that stem from family breakdown, including
    depression, anxiety, rebellion, academic failure, social withdrawal, addiction to pornoraphy, immorality, and 
    drug abuse. The Apostle Paul warned that in the last days
    many will be “disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection,
    . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God” (2 Timothy 3:2-4).
    President Hinckley stressed the urgent need for effective parenting to address such
    challenges: “My plea—and I wish I were more eloquent in voicing it—is a plea to save
    the children. Too many of them walk with pain and fear, in loneliness and despair.
    Children need sunlight. They need happiness. They need love and nurture. They need
    kindness and refreshment and affection. Every home, regardless of the cost of the house,
    can provide an environment of love which will be an environment of salvation.” (Section 1, p. 1-3)
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>2. Communicating with Love:</strong> Christ-like values and communication in love is one of the best 
    ways for parents and children to somewhat know each other and trust build. One should stop bad 
    things - stop saying no more than once; talk only when asked, talk without getting angry at once say 
    how you really feel or what you expect. Children also need conversation - children create good deeds, 
    say good things, praise; bad things to laughter delightful mouthful say how they feel. Parents are kind, 
    know how they feel and should be known, speak without conviction when they have the need to meet their 
    need, speak to their children in love, a way that shows that they know how to be patient. This is another 
    way to raise them then in love and righteousness. (Section 3, p. 9-13)
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>3. Nurturing Children:</strong> "Nurturing children is define as love and care carefully balancing the 
    child physical, emotional, and spritual needs" (Hinckley, p. 15). This will allow parents to 
    help children to overcome challenges in both present and in the future. As the site mentioned that 
    nuturing includes empathy, understand how the children's feelings, and tried to keep in touch with them 
    and find solutions for it. Nurturing parents can help children to figure out the ways to solve their own problems.
    (Section 4, p. 14-17) 
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>4. Fostering Confidence:</strong> Parents must need to fostering confidence in children, which can help childrens to 
    improve their well-being and achievement. When children feels confident, they will experience healthier, happier, 
    and able to manage social and emotional challenges. Building confidence in children, parents need to love and respect 
    and to understand how the children feels like. Therefore, Parents must also need to encourage childrens to have faith in 
    God, so that they will also rely on God's help to solve their daily problems. Moreover, parents 
    can foster confidence through faith, virtue, integrity, and competence by following these principles, 
    teaching children to trust God and themselves. Doing all these will help children to become confident. (Section 5, p. 19-21)
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>5. Overcoming Anger:</strong> As President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "overcoming anger can help family to build stronger relationship and 
    bring peace in family" and "Anger can affect love and affection in family." He emphasize that when we need to overcome anger, 
    we need to pray to our Heavenly Father for help guide us the right path, considering the issues, and start to take action to 
    solve the issues. Also, we need to avoid things that cause us anger, participate in recreational activities, and focusing on 
    spiritual growth. These principles can help us to feel patience, kindness, and great interactions with one another between 
    parent and children. (Section 6, p. 23-26)
