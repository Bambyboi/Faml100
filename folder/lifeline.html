    <h3>Partnership Equality <hr></h3>
    

    <div class="container">
        <p style="font-size: 19px;">In couples Partnership equality means in Latter Day-saint church, this chapter stated that 
            Equality in LDS definition, is all too often used to mean
            “identity”; that is, that two equal things must be identical to each other. Such usage 
            represents a fallen and harmful understanding of equality that is espoused by Lucifer, 
            who passionately wants all to be “like . . . himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). Therefore, this opens up a 
            great meaning about equality for spouse to not be confused on as Lucifer is trying make it hard for us to
            understand. In opinion, having a deeper understanding in equality will help couples relationship 
            feel more connected, appreciated, and understood. Although, it will build healthy partnership for 
            your children and prepare them to do the same thing towards their own family if they get Married.

                Equality of Men and Women
            </a>
            <br> 
            This lds site provide various of selected teachings about equality in Men and Women. My favorite selected teachings in this
            site is <strong>Elder Faust</strong>. He shared that “How should those who bear the priesthood treat their wives 
            and the other women in their family? He emphasize that our wives need to be cherished. 
            They need to hear their husbands call them blessed, and the children need to hear their fathers generously
            praise their mothers (<a style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Proverbs-31-28/">see</a> Proverbs 31:28). 
            The Lord values his daughters just as much as he does his sons. In marriage, neither is superior; each has a 
            different primary and divine responsibility. Chief among these different responsibilities for wives is the 
            calling of motherhood. I firmly believe that our dear faithful sisters enjoy a special spiritual enrichment 
            which is inherent in their natures” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 54; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 38-39).
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, “Both fathers and mothers do many intrinsically different things for their children. Both mothers and 
            fathers are equipped to nurture children, but their approaches are different. Mothers seem to take a 
            dominant role in preparing children to live within their families, present and future. Fathers seem best 
            equipped to prepare children to function in the environment outside the family” (in Conference Report, Apr. 
            1993, 44-45; or Ensign, May 1993, 35). As I read this article, this explained how important of parenting role 
            in partnership. Even thou Father and Mother have different parenting role towards their children. But similarly, 
            parents wants the best version of their children. Therefore, the father and mother parenting role mentioned above
            help their children prepare their life experience in family (mother parenting role) and outside real-world 
            (father parenting role). This could make the equality contribution of a father and mother parenting role of raising their childrens.

        <p style="font-size: 19px;">
           
            As the thread of support that keeps a marriage alive, communication serves as a connection between a couple's 
            emotions and thoughts (Hudson & Miller, 2012, ch4). Effective communication is not just a skill in an environment 
            of fair partnership, but also an important component that strengthens commitment. Open communication between 
            partners helps to create a trusting and understanding environment. This openness helps the husband and wife 
            have a same goal and goal for their marriage in addition to strengthening their relationship. When partners
            actively listen to one another, have deep conversations, and work together to make decisions that have an 
            impact on their lives, commitment grows.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Equality and Love in Latter-day Saint Doctrine
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;">Open and honest communication between partners is essential to strengthening 
            commitment and working together (Hudson & Miller, 2012, ch4). This involves creating a secure environment
            where both partners can express themselves without worrying about being judged. Establishing a deeper 
            relationship can be made easier by regularly talking about goals and expressing personal goals. Finding 
            common ground, appreciating one another's opinions, and settling disagreements in a respectful manner 
            are further components of effective communication. Honoring successes—individual and collective—creates 
            a favorable environment that strengthens commitment.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Stewards in Equal Partnership</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;">Communication problems are a common occurrence for couples on their path to 
            equitable partnership (Hudson & Miller, 2012, ch4). Conflicts may arise from misunderstandings, unspoken 
            expectations, and different communication styles. It takes constant communication to strike the right 
            balance between individual goals and team goals. Real-life problems including parenting styles, 
            employment choices, and money worries require respectful and honest communication. A strong and long-lasting 
            partnership needs the partners handle these problems together and make a commitment to understanding one 
            another's opinions. By accepting communication as a lifeline, couples can overcome challenges and strengthen 
            their resolve to have a happy and satisfying marriage.</p>
