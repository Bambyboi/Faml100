    <h3>Partnership Equality <hr></h3>
    

    <div class="container">
        <p style="font-size: 19px;">In couples Partnership equality means in Latter Day-saint church, this chapter stated that 
            Equality in LDS definition, is all too often used to mean
            “identity”; that is, that two equal things must be identical to each other. Such usage 
            represents a fallen and harmful understanding of equality that is espoused by Lucifer, 
            who passionately wants all to be “like . . . himself” (2 Nephi 2:27). Therefore, this opens up a 
            great meaning about equality for spouse to not be confused on as Lucifer is trying make it hard for us to
            understand. In my opinion, having a deeper understanding in equality will help couples relationship 
            feel more connected, appreciated, and understood. Although, it will build healthy partnership for 
            your children and prepare them to do the same thing towards their own family if they get Married.

            <strong>In the LDS institute Eternal marriage student manuel:</strong> <a target="_blank" style="color: blanchedalmond;" href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/equality-of-men-and-women?lang=eng">
                Equality of Men and Women
            </a>
            <br> 
            This lds site provide various of selected teachings about equality in Men and Women. My favorite selected teachings in this
            site is <strong>Elder Faust</strong>. He shared that “How should those who bear the priesthood treat their wives 
            and the other women in their family? He emphasize that our wives need to be cherished. 
            They need to hear their husbands call them blessed, and the children need to hear their fathers generously
            praise their mothers (<a style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Proverbs-31-28/">see</a> Proverbs 31:28). 
            The Lord values his daughters just as much as he does his sons. In marriage, neither is superior; each has a 
            different primary and divine responsibility. Chief among these different responsibilities for wives is the 
            calling of motherhood. I firmly believe that our dear faithful sisters enjoy a special spiritual enrichment 
            which is inherent in their natures” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1993, 54; or Ensign, Nov. 1993, 38-39).
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, “Both fathers and mothers do many intrinsically different things for their children. Both mothers and 
            fathers are equipped to nurture children, but their approaches are different. Mothers seem to take a 
            dominant role in preparing children to live within their families, present and future. Fathers seem best 
            equipped to prepare children to function in the environment outside the family” (in Conference Report, Apr. 
            1993, 44-45; or Ensign, May 1993, 35). As I read this article, this explained how important of parenting role 
            in partnership. Even thou Father and Mother have different parenting role towards their children. But similarly, 
            parents wants the best version of their children. Therefore, the father and mother parenting role mentioned above
            help their children prepare their life experience in family (mother parenting role) and outside real-world 
            (father parenting role). This could make the equality contribution of a father and mother parenting role of raising their childrens.

            Adam and Eve and the plan of happiness</a></h2>
        
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">
           
            In this chapter, it mentioned that God created Adam and Eve equally in both spiritually and physically. 
            In <a target="_blank" style="color: blanchedalmond;" href="https://www.instituteofreligion.org/?&sw=pgp&bk=moses&ch=2&vs=27">Moses 2: 27</a> "And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only 
            Begotten created I him; male and female created I them." Therefore, This was done spiritually in 
            your premortal existence when you lived in the presence of your Father in Heaven. Your gender 
            existed before you came to earth. You elected to have this earth experience as part of His plan for you.
            This is called the plan of Salvation known as the plan of happiness. Adam and Eve ate the 
            forbidden fruit they were tempted by Satan. Which letting us know that Satan has his own plan to conquer the 
            children of God from not recieving the plan of happiness. In other hand, Eve ate the fruit to open the portal for 
            human existence. "Adam hearkened first to Eve, accepted from her the fruit of the first tree, 
            and entered into mortal-ity, so Eve would hearken to Adam, accept from him the fruit of the second 
            tree, and enter into eternal life. When viewing the entire plan of happiness, we see that the man and 
            the woman play equally powerful and equally important roles in the plan. Each is to hearken to the 
            other for the plan to work. Each stands before the other, and in the sight of God, as equals" 
            (Hudson & Miller, ch4, p. 40).

            <br>
            <br>
            As I read through this quotes by Hudson and Miller about Adam and Eve plan of happiness, explained that there is a balance 
            equality in the roles of men and women. Since Adam listened and followed Eve's actions when they were in the Garden of Eden,
            and this let them both entered mortal life. In return, it suggests that Eve, in another aspect of the plan, 
            would listen to Adam so they could enter into eternal life. This let us know that both men and 
            women have important and equal roles in this plan. The word "hearken" means to listen and obey, 
            so it's saying that each partner should listen and respect the other. The idea is that for this 
            plan to succeed, both men and women need to play equally powerful and important roles, standing 
            before each other as equals, with mutual respect and work together as one heart.

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Equality and Love in Latter-day Saint Doctrine
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 19px;">
            
            The article explores the deep relationship that Latter-day Saint doctrine has between 
            equality and love. It says that in order to raise a child to a place of equality, someone 
            above them must make sacrifices for an equal in order show true and pure love. The thought 
            is realized in the Atonement of Jesus, where people are made equal heirs with Him by reason 
            of His greater sacrifice (Doctrine and Covenants [D&C] 88:107). "Parental love in mortality 
            emulates godly love. Those with healthy parental love make sacrifices so that their 
            children may one day stand as their equals, and be not only their children, but also 
            their friends" (Hudson & Miller, ch4, p. 40). Therefore, parental love is shown as a 
            guidelines where sacrifices are made so that children can finally stand as equals and loved 
            ones, reflecting the love of God. A Zion community lives the fullness of this commandment. 
            Zion, as we know, is a place where the Saints are equal in both heavenly and temporal 
            things (D&C 70:14; 78:5-7). Therefore, In order to create Zion communities where equality rules 
            in both the heavenly and human realms, "we must love thy neighbors and remove any 
            discordance between the ideal and the lived situation" (Hudson & Miller, ch4, p. 40).

            <br>
            <br>

            Although, Genesis 2:24 highlights Adam's inaugural declaration after marrying Eve, 
            asserting their equality and oneness as "one flesh." This means a partnership, 
            indicating that the marital relationship involves more than physical unity; 
            have emotional, spiritual, and relational unity as well. "Man and Women cannot form 
            a relationship that will be blessed by God if they come to the marriage 
            altar unsure of each other's equality, doubting it, or not even thinking about how it 
            should order their relations" (Hudson & Miller, ch4, p.40). According to this quote, spouses needs to 
            have an open communication before marriage to identifies there values to help them understand
            each one's feelings and let them to have an evaluations of their equality. 

            <br>
            <br>
            In the image below that is my sister Helen and her husband Siaosi. I would like to share a story about my sister
            getting married to a non-member man. This is the biggest issue to them, an unequal beliefs in church, 
            and I know this could lead them to broken relationship. Although, It's been almost three years of their 
            marriage. I see lot of issues in their relationship. For example, both of them don't agree on 
            going to one another's church and that 
            is the biggest problem and biggest fear to me as well. Because, this issues could lead them to a divorce. 
            Right now they haven't been talking for about three months now since their last argument about church beliefs. And 
            it has affected the child development of their 3 years old child. To avoid this, they should've had an open communication
            with one another according to their values and standard, whether they have the same values (equality) or not (inequality)

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">Stewards in Equal Partnership</h2>
       
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>Family stewardships should be understood in 
            terms of their responsibilities obligations to one's spouse, not power over one's spouse. Moreover, I will listed 
            down some key facts about Stewardship in family partnership. Stewardship in equal partnership is about 
            roles and responsability that couples need to do in their family. 
            For example, collaborating with one another based on "managing the family duties, 
            making right decision, and support each others personal goals" for improvement of 
            their family and marriage. In order to have a firm and happy family, they need to express one another
            emotions and feelings about the roles that I just mentioned. And they must able to come up with an equal mindset on 
            each roles.

        <ul style="color: lightgray; font-size: 13px; margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;"> 
            <strong><p>Shared Decision-Making and Responsibilities: </p></strong> 
            <p>
                In a fair partnership in couples, 
                stewardship is defined by mutual engagement with family management and decision-making. 
                This approach stands in contrast with established examples, which give one partner—typically 
                the husband—a significant role. According to Hunter (1994, p. 51), LDS teachings promote a 
                relationship in which "the wife be... a companion equal and necessary in full partnership" 
                and where decisions are made together, indicating a shared stewardship over family matters. 
                Elder L. Tom Perry elaborates on this idea by saying, "A family does not have a president or 
                vice president. According to Perry (2004) on page 71, "We have copresidents working 'together 
                eternally for the good of their family'." Therefore, couples need to contribute to the family 
                role equally if they want a happy family. So they could increase their relationship.

            </p> 
            <strong><p>Rejecting Hierarchical Traditions:</p></strong> 
            <p>
                Spouse need to rejecting traditions or social conventions that harm partners' equality like shaking hands 
                when greeting someone that is opposite gender, standing up for someone that you drawn attention with, 
                and making eye contact during a conversation. 
                This is another key facts about the idea of stewardship in equal 
                partnerships. In chapter 4 Elder Scott stated, "That is not the way of the Lord... 
                That is a cruel, mistaken vision of marriage encouraged by Lucifer that every priesthood holder 
                must reject,"(Scott, 2008, p. 46). Therefore, stewardship is about equality and 
                respect for one another, not about power and dominance. This is also mentioned in 
                (<a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/3/Genesis-3-16.html#:~:text=ESV%20To%20the%20woman%20he,he%20shall%20rule%20over%20you.%E2%80%9D"
                style="color: blanchedalmond;" target="_blank">see </a>Genesis 3:16), 
                it says "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring 
                forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to husband, but he shall rule over you."
               
               
               
                <!--In Genesis 3:16 it clarified in Latter-day Saint doctrine as 
                Adam "ruling with" Eve, emphasizing partnership rather than dominance.

                For example: A couple, when facing challenges, adopts a collaborative 
                approach, ruling "with" each other in decision-making and problem-solving-->
            </p>    
            

    
                    
            <strong><p>Encouraging One Another's Development:</p></strong> 
                <p>
                    Encouraging one another's personal 
                    and spiritual development is an important part of stewardship in an equal 
                    relationship. This involves when couples supporting one another in accomplishing their personal 
                    goals. "You have always given me wings to fly, and I have loved you for it," (Hinckley, 2004, p. 85). 
                    President Gordon B. Hinckley said this an emotional reflection on his marriage and it was so meaningful. 
                    Therefore, this is another supporting point of stewardship mentioned by Elder Hinckley, 
                    which emphasize that each partner's have one heart, and mind in their decision making, family 
                    management, and in their responsability roles. 
                   
                    <!--
                    The doctrine emphasizes gender equality as a commandment, requiring individuals to presume the equality of their spouses when approaching marriage, fostering genuine love and deeper visions of equality in procreation and parenthood.

                    Before marriage, a couple discusses and agrees upon the principle of equality, committing to viewing each other as equals in all aspects of their shared life, fostering a foundation of love and understanding.
                    -->
               
                </p>
            <strong><p>Shared Domestic Responsibilities:</p></strong> 
                <p>
                  
                    The idea of stewardship is further developed in LDS teachings to include shared duties for 
                    household chores and parenting. As (Hudson & Miller, ch4, p.42) include Elder Packers quote into this 
                    chapter. "There is no task, however menial, connected with the care of 
                    babies, the nurturing of children, or with the maintenance of the home that is not [the husband's] 
                    equal obligation." This emphasizing the equal responsibility of both 
                    couples in these areas like their duties and responsability or parenting towards their childrens (Packer, 1989, p. 75).
                    Therefore, a great example for shared domestic responsability are, firstly,
                    sharing household chores shows a 
                    commitment of a spouse in relationship. When couples apply this in their relationship, it show 
                    mutual respest to each others time and contribution. Secondly, Enhancing communication and teamwork will 
                    help them to easily to manage their family decision and problem-solving. Last but not least, 
                    deepening emotional connection and appreciation. This will help couples feel satisfy and feel like both of them 
                    are value and important to one another.
                    
    
                    
                  <!--
                    Latter-day Saint doctrine explicitly rejects hierarchical marriages, discouraging notions of dominance, control, or regulation of family affairs, as such perspectives are considered mistaken and influenced by false traditions.

                    A husband actively rejects traditional notions of dominance and control, ensuring that decision-making is a joint effort where both partners contribute equally to family affairs.
                  -->


                </p>
            
            
            <!--<strong><p>Equal Partnership in Decision-Making:</p></strong> 
            <p>
                Decision-making within marriages is portrayed as a joint responsibility, where spouses share in decisions and work together equally, as opposed to one holding a superior position.
            
                A couple engages in open communication, actively involving each other in major decisions, and ensuring that neither partner dominates the decision-making process, maintaining an equal partnership.
            
            </p>
          
            <strong><p>Presiding and Partnership:</p></strong> 

            <p> 
                The stewardship of priesthood is described as not imposing a hierarchical relationship over the God-ordained equality between husband and wife. Instead, it emphasizes coequal roles of fathers and mothers in the family.

                A family operates on the principle of coequal roles, with both spouses actively participating in decision-making and family governance, emphasizing partnership rather than hierarchical authority.
                
             </p>

             <strong><p>Revolutionary Aspects of the Restored Gospel:</p></strong> 

             <p> 
                The restored gospel is celebrated for envisioning difference without hierarchy and distinctiveness without inequality, aligning with the proclamation's call for an ideal relationship between husbands and wives.

                A couple, guided by their faith, embraces the revolutionary concept of distinctiveness without hierarchy, fostering an environment where both partners' strengths are valued equally.
              </p>

              <strong><p>Mutual Assistance in Stewardships:</p></strong> 

              <p> 
                Equal partners assist one another in their respective responsibilities, including housework and childcare, with both spouses sharing equal obligations.

                  A husband takes an active role in childcare and housework, acknowledging that these responsibilities are not solely the wife's duty but a shared obligation in maintaining the household.

               <p> 

                   Marriages should not only be about responsibilities but also shared and individual dreams. Spouses are encouraged to support each other's aspirations, creating room for personal growth within the partnership.

                   A wife pursues her individual dreams with the full support and encouragement of her husband, illustrating a marriage that allows room for both partners to grow personally and professionally.

                <strong><p>Avoidance of Dominance and Subservience: </p></strong> 

                <p> 
 
                    Both partners are obligated to refrain from thoughts and actions that may lead to dominance or subservience, ensuring the preservation of equal partnership as envisioned in Latter-day Saint doctrine.

                    A couple consciously avoids scenarios where one partner dominates decisions, ensuring that both spouses actively engage in discussions, respecting each other's opinions and avoiding any form of subservience.
