    <h3>Forgiveness and Repentance <hr></h3>


    <div class="container">
     
        <div >

                <p>Combining knowledge I have gained from chapters 6 and 14, it is clear that repentance, forgiveness, 
                    understanding, and communication are very important aspect for a 
                    marriage to be successful. In my opinion the requirement to make sure that both spouses feel appreciated 
                    and cherished, especially when it comes to family planning and commitment. Open communication
                    will provide spouses a thorough understanding and create an environment that is suitable to 
                    forgive and repent one another as they go through challanges in life so that they provide 
                    the solid foundation for maintaining a strong, loving marriage, keeping promises, and working 
                    together to make decisions in life.</p>

                    <p>
                        In chapter 6 by Gardner and Greiner. It emphasize that if any couples are not being honest 
                        in Honoring Marital Vows with Complete Fidelity. Such as involving in these kind of A Typology of Infidelity:
                        Fantasy infidelity where couple have dirty mind over someone, Visual Infidelity/Pornography where husbands and wifes
                        watched others naked, Romantic Infidelity where one person have emotions outside the primary relationships, 
                        and Sexual Infidelity where one person have sexual intercourse to someone that is outside the primary relationship. 
                        Therefore, Satan will try to convince us that we can find happiness in infidelity. Even though it may 
                        seem for a time that everything is wonderful. President Benson (1988, p. 285) warned and stated a quote
                        <i>“Quickly the relationship will sour. Guilt and shame set in. We become fearful that our 
                        sins will be discovered. We must sneak and hide, lie and cheat. Love begins to die. 
                        Bitterness, jealousy, anger, and even hate begin to grow”</i> (Gardner & Greiner, ch6). Im my personal thoughts
                        about this quote, if couples have any involvement into these infidelity sins and if they want to make a change in
                        theirlives. Forgiveness and Repentance require to rebuild any couples bond that has been affected 
                        by these unforgivable sins. But to be aware of this infidelity, this chapter provided
                        Wall of preventing infidelity which listed below (Broderick, 1991; Glass, 1999; Goddard, 2007).

                       <li style="color: lightgray; font-size: 15px;"> Don't share the most painful things of your soul with an attractive alternative. 
                        This develops deep levels of intimacy.</li>
                       <li style="color: lightgray; font-size: 15px;"> If a conversation makes light of marriage, respond with something positive 
                        about your own marriage. </li>
                       <li style="color: lightgray; font-size: 15px;">Discuss marital issues with your spouse. Work on the problems at home. 
                        If you do need to talk to someone else about your marriage, be sure he or 
                        she is a friend of the marriage.</li>

                       </ul>

                    </p>
              
                        
                        <p>In Chapter 14 Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives, 
                            it contain a quote that "repentance is not just a one-time act but an ongoing
                            effort to improve self-improvement in marriage" (Hawkins et al., 2012). By doing this, we need to
                            have an honest and open communication in admitting faults and mistakes, to help spouses and us to have 
                            a deep connections overcoming each one's challanges. "The 
                            problem to effective communication often comes from pride", as President Ezra Taft Benson 
                            mentioned in his talk on pride, stating that the proud do not receive counsel easily and 
                            tend to justify their shortcomings (Benson, 1989). Therefore, spouses must lower their pride, and 
                            increasing mutual respect to one another as they admit their mistakes and wrong doings, so they could seek
                            forgiveness and working together as a team to overcome challanges to maintain trust in their relationship.  </p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">In Chapter 20 Repentance and forgiveness</h3>
                        
                        <p>In this chapter 20, I learned so much about forgiveness and repentance as Walton and Hendricks as
                            they shared their opinion. I learned that prayer together with your partner everyday could 
                            improve forgiveness and repentance in them. The impact of prayer can reducing the level of 
                            arguments, encouraging cooperation, and encouraging forgiveness in marriages. 
                            "Even in challenging situations, involving God in prayer has been demonstrated to reduce 
                            anger, bring peace back, and change relationship goals" (Walton 
                            & Hendricks, 2022). </p>

                        <p>
                            From the Worthington and Wade's Pyramid model of forgiveness. I learned the steps that each of us and couples
                            need to follow inorder maintain happiness in family. "As part of the repentance process, 
                            acknowledging the crime, showing regret, and making reparations are essential steps 
                            that culminate in the victim deciding to forgive" (Worthington & Wade, 2021). Moreover, the these steps
                            will help marriages improved their values including openness, understanding, and commitment to make a change
                            for the couples to maintain a firm bond.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my point of view, repentance and forgiveness is very important for healing personal hurt feelings,
                            building the relationship strong, reduces resentment and anger, building trust, and improving well-being 
                            in a relationship. My parents used to get really upset with each other over disagreements about who was 
                            responsible for what in the family. For instance, after work, my dad doesn't take any responsibility for 
                            my family. And the reason my mother lost it and made them stop interacting with each other. We had a family 
                            home evening one evening, and I told them what I had learnt from this class. I told them that being able to 
                            communicate and understand each other freely will enable them to come up with a plan that benefits them 
                            both, after our family home evening. They were open comunication with one another and understanding of 
                            one another. My dad explained that he's very tired from work and he need a rest. Then my mom 
                            agreed and understand she came up with a plan that assigning me and my siblings 
                            own duties and responsability to complete everyday, could help them to solved things keep the peace. 
                            After few weeks, things work fine for both of them and they end forgiving each other. Although, 
                            Repentance and forgiveness serve as a means of resolving conflicts, maintain peace, 
                            and strengthening connections between families both socially and inside the family.(Walton & Hendricks, 2022).

                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Millers Speech about forgiveness and repentance</h3>
                        <p>
                            The important of forgiveness and repentance in marriage was given by Richard B. Miller speech, 
                            a professor in BYU's School of Family Life. Miller explained how these ideas might improve and 
                            mend marital ties in a revolutionary way. He clarified, "Besides a sincere apology, repentance 
                            includes striving to forsake our shortcomings and weaknesses... 
                            As we continually repent, we constantly try to improve ourselves" (Miller, 2010). 
                            This quotes by Miller will help couples to ongoing process of self-improvement and let them to 
                            let go of previous mistakes for better relationship, which will cause as they 
                            demonstrate repentance and forgiveness to one another</p>

                        <p>
                            Miller shared another importance fact about forgiveness in marriage, he said it is cure for anger,
                            which he mentioned or reffered it as a "lethal poison" harmonious relationships. He stated that "Forgiveness
                            is the cure for the poison of resentment." Therefore, resentment is actually neutralized by forgiveness. So
                            than it can create space in our hearts for deepening and increasing our love (Miller, 2010). Forgiveness
                            is a deep healing process to increase and strengthens a marriage, rather than getting a divorce. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using President James E. Faust's teachings as a guide, Miller emphasized the Atonement's 
                            ability to provide comfort and healing to those who were hurt within addition to forgiveness 
                            for the transgressor, highlighting the Atonement's comprehensive ability to rebuild and 
                            strengthen marital bonds. He said, "Through the Atonement He lifts from us sorrow and pain, 
                            which then gives us the capacity to forgive our spouse when he or she has seriously offended 
                            us" (Miller, 2010, p. 2). This provides light on the Atonement's unique role in 
                            atonement and repentance, providing hope for marriages that are strained due to miscommunication 
                            and transgressions.

                                Forgiveness and repentance are necessary for healing past hurts and 
                                confusion in a married partnership and it allows couples to put their 
                                disagreements behind them and create a closer, more compassionate bond.

                                opinion, feelings and expectations is part of a forgiveness. Because it will let them

                                By allowing both couples to move past complaints and mistakes, forgiveness 
                                reduces resentment and anger, which may let both have a honesty conversation. 
                                In my opinion, repentance and forgiveness from one spouse can heal emotional wounds and create 
                                a more understanding and supporting one another. This will make easier for both partners 
                                to communicate their wants and feelings honestly as a result of this emotional 
                                healing process as they are no longer afraid of judgment.</p>

                                Repentance may allow both couples to comform each other from past mistakes and allow them
                                to gain much more trust in them. Because trust is increased through mutual exchange and become easier
                                for them to have a open communication if they experience the same issues. 
                                
                             </p>
                                
                       
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I have learned so much about forgiveness and repentance from Millers talks as I mentioned above.
                            It shows me the importance of having open communication is a great demonstration of forgiveness and repentance
                            in couples. To firm their relationships bond and improving their interactions with each other. </p>
