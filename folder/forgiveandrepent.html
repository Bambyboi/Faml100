    <h3>Forgiveness and Repentance <hr></h3>


    <div class="container">
     
        <div >

                <p>Combining the knowledge I have gained from chapters 6 and 14, it is clear that repentance, forgiveness, 
                    understanding, and communication are very important aspects for a marriage to be successful. In my opinion, 
                    the requirement is to make sure that both spouses feel appreciated and cherished, especially when it comes 
                    to family planning and commitment. Open communication will provide spouses with a thorough understanding 
                    and create an environment that is suitable to forgive and repent one another as they go through challenges 
                    in life so that they provide the solid foundation for maintaining a strong, loving marriage, keeping 
                    promises, and working together to make life decisions.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In chapter 6 by Gardner and Greiner. It emphasizes that if any couples are not being honest in honoring 
                        marital vows with complete fidelity, Such as involving in this kind of A Typology of Infidelity: 
                        Fantasy infidelity, where a couple has a dirty mind over someone; visual infidelity or pornography, 
                        where husbands and wives watch others naked; romantic infidelity, where one person has emotions outside 
                        the primary relationship; and sexual infidelity, where one person has sexual intercourse with someone 
                        outside the primary relationship. Therefore, Satan will try to convince us that we can find happiness 
                        in infidelity. Even though it may seem for a time that everything is wonderful, President Benson (1988, p. 
                        285) warned and stated a quote: <i>"Quickly, the relationship will sour. Guilt and shame set in. We become 
                        fearful that our sins will be discovered. We must sneak, hide, lie, and cheat. Love begins to die. 
                        Bitterness, jealousy, anger, and even hate begin to grow”</i> (Gardner & Greiner, ch. 6). My personal thoughts 
                        about this quote are whether couples have any involvement in these infidelity sins and if they want to make 
                        a change in their lives. Forgiveness and repentance are required to rebuild any couple's bond that has been 
                        affected by these unforgivable sins. But to be aware of this infidelity, this chapter provided a Wall of 
                        Preventing Infidelity, which is listed below (Broderick, 1991; Glass, 1999; Goddard, 2007).

                        <p>In Chapter 14: Successful Marriages and Families: Proclamation Principles and Research Perspectives, it contains the quote that "repentance is not just a one-time act but an ongoing effort to improve self-improvement in marriage" (Hawkins et al., 2012). By doing this, we need to have honest and open communication in admitting faults and mistakes to help our spouses and us have deep connections that overcome each other's challenges. "The problem with effective communication often comes from pride,"  as President Ezra Taft Benson mentioned in his talk on pride, stating that the proud do not receive counsel easily and tend to justify their shortcomings (Benson, 1989). Therefore, spouses must lower their pride and increase mutual respect for one another as they admit their mistakes and wrongdoings, so they can seek forgiveness and work together as a team to overcome challenges and maintain trust in their relationship.

                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">In Chapter 20 Repentance and forgiveness</h3>
                        
                        <p>In this chapter 20, I learned so much about forgiveness and repentance from Walton 
                            and Hendricks as they shared their opinions. I learned that praying together with your 
                            partner every day could improve forgiveness and repentance in them. The impact of prayer 
                            can reduce the level of arguments, encourage cooperation, and encourage forgiveness in 
                            marriages. "Even in challenging situations, involving God in prayer has been demonstrated 
                            to reduce anger, bring peace back, and change relationship goals" (Walton & Hendricks, nd). 
                            Holeman emphasizes that "apologies facilitate forgiveness, and forgiveness motivates 
                            repentance" (Holeman, 2008). Therefore, couples need to apologize to each other when they 
                            have family issues and also pray so God will guide them through problems. </p>

                        <p>
                            Repentance and forgiveness are "an interactive process that strengthens families" and "two 
                            sides of the same coin" (Worthington, 2006). An interactive process means that repentance 
                            and forgiveness are not just one-time acts; they need active participation from both offenders 
                            and victims, including repentance, where one person acknowledges the mistakes for the improvement 
                            of the behavior to prevent any issues, and forgiveness, where the wronged person apologizes and 
                            lets go of the mistake and moves on. "Two sides of the same coin" means that repentance and 
                            forgiveness are equally crucial in the reconciliation process. As we think of a coin, a coin 
                            cannot exist without two sides, and conflicts and healing of relationships cannot occur without 
                            both repentance from the offender and forgiveness from the offended. From the Worthington Pyramid 
                            model of forgiveness. I learned the steps that each of us and couples need to follow in order to 
                            maintain happiness in the family. "As part of the repentance process, acknowledging the crime, 
                            showing regret, and making reparations are essential steps that culminate in the victim deciding
                             to forgive" (Worthington & Wade, p. 206). Moreover, these steps will help marriages improve 
                             their values, including openness, understanding, and commitment to make a change for the couples 
                             to maintain a firm bond.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In my opinion, repentance and forgiveness are very important for healing personal hurt 
                            feelings, building strong relationships, reducing resentment and anger, building trust, 
                            and improving well-being in a relationship. My parents used to get really upset with each 
                            other over disagreements over who's responsible for duties in the family. For instance, 
                            after work, my dad doesn't take any responsibility for my family. And the reason my mother 
                            lost it was because she made them stop interacting with each other. We had a family home 
                            evening one evening, and I told them what I had learned from this class. I told them that 
                            being able to communicate and understand each other freely will enable them to come up with 
                            a plan that benefits them both after our family home evening. They had open communication 
                            with one another and an understanding of one another. My dad explained that he's very tired 
                            from work and needs a rest. Then my mom agreed and understood; she came up with a plan that 
                            assigning me and my siblings our own duties and responsibilities to complete every day could help 
                            them solve things and keep the peace. After a few weeks, things work out fine for both of them, 
                            and they end up forgiving each other. Although repentance and forgiveness serve as a means of 
                            resolving conflicts, maintaining peace, and strengthening connections between families both 
                            socially and inside the family, (Walton & Hendricks, ch. 20).

                           <li><strong>2. Feel sorrow for the sin:</strong> Feeling sorrowful, we are humble and submissive before

                            <ul style="margin: 2em; color: lightgray; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 0;">
                           <li><strong>1. Recall the hurt:</strong> I know that all of us wants to protect ourselves from pain and suffering, 
                            so we put an effort to ignore and forget the pain that cause by offense and try to avoid the 
                            shame of facing it in public. Therefore, we must acknowledge the issue and be clear about the 
                            wrongdoings before we can forgive.
                        </li>
                           <br>
                           <li> <strong>2. Empathize:</strong> Empathy is being able to see things from another person's feelings 
                            or opinion through their evaluation. It's important to understand their feeling so that they can 
                            think of a solution and apply forgiveness. Like evaluating these kind questions is finding the solutions: 
                            Was the mistake done on purpose, or was it an innocent mistakes? 
                            What were the events that led the offender carry 
                            out the crime? Is there an understandable reason for the offender to disagree with the victim 
                            regarding the seriousness of the offense? What kind of violence might the offender have 
                            experienced in the past? What pain might the offender be experiencing associated with guilt and 
                            remorse? Having these in mind will help us to create a better decision of making a solution for the 
                            issues.
                            
                            
                        </li>

                            <li><strong>3. Offer the altruistic gift of forgiveness:</strong> When the victim is humbled by an 
                                acknowledgment of his or her own behavior and her own awareness, and expresses 
                                specific thanks for the times when they were freely forgiven, forgiving with 
                                altruism becomes easier. In my group dicussion about repentance and forgiveness. She 
                                shared that wrtting her thoughts and feelings in diary will help her to think for a better improvement
                                and establish awareness between the offender and the victim.  
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li><strong>4. Commit publicly to forgive:</strong> The victim has a better chance of successful forgiveness 
                                if he or she verbalizes the forgiveness commitment to another person (for example, telling 
                                a friend or counselor about the decision). Some victims have formalized their decision by 
                                writing a letter, making a journal entry, or creating a certificate of forgiveness.

                            <li><strong>5. Hold on to forgiveness:</strong>
                                 After completing the forgiveness process, victims may still 
                                be haunted on occasion by the pain of the offense. During this stage it is important to 
                                move forward. When thoughts revert to the painful injury, the victim is reminded that the 
                                decision to forgive has already been made. He or she does not have to repeat that process. 
                                Also, it is important for the victim to remember that having forgiven, he or she has promised 
                                that there will be no paybacks or grudges. Although painful memories are not necessarily 
                                replaced by forgiveness, the pain should be a reminder to move forward with one's life 
                                instead of revisiting the transgression committed against him or her. Deliberate efforts 
                                to stop unwanted thoughts are often unsuccessful. Instead, when victims have successfully 
                                reframed their thought processes, it is probably because they have replaced the unwanted 
                                thoughts with something more meaningful or important.

                                I like to share a story that me and my girlfriend got into fight and arguments.
                                 Because she cheated on me.
                                I wasn't eaten for 3 wks staright because of angry and led me feel like not forgiving her. 
                                In my times of healing, I was able to forgive her by forgetting
                                the past mistakes. Even tho memories cannot be removed and led me to have unstable forgiveness process, 
                                but to holding on to forgiveness process steps that was mentioned by Worthington, could help 
                                me to stable my forgiveness and repentance to her. For me right now, I am so fully healed and I forgets all of
                                her wrongdoings through the help of this proclamation.

                        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Millers Speech about forgiveness and repentance</h3>
                        <p>
                            The importance of forgiveness and repentance in marriage was given by Richard B. Miller, 
                            a professor in BYU's School of Family Life. Miller explained how these ideas might improve 
                            and mend marital ties in a revolutionary way. He clarified, "Besides a sincere apology, 
                            repentance includes striving to forsake our shortcomings and weaknesses. As we continually 
                            repent, we constantly try to improve ourselves" (Miller, 2010). This quote by Miller will
                             help couples in their ongoing process of self-improvement and let them let go of previous 
                             mistakes for a better relationship, which will cause them to demonstrate repentance and 
                             forgiveness toward one another.</p>

                        <p>
                            Miller shared another important fact about forgiveness in marriage: he said it is a cure for 
                            anger, which he mentioned or reffered as a "lethal poison" in harmonious relationships. He 
                            stated that "forgiveness is the cure for the poison of resentment." Therefore, forgiveness 
                            actually neutralizes resentment. So that it can create space in our hearts for deepening and 
                            increasing our love (Miller, 2010). Forgiveness is a deep healing process that increases and 
                            strengthens a marriage, rather than getting a divorce.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using President James E. Faust's teachings as a guide, Miller emphasized the atonement's 
                            ability to provide comfort and healing to those who were hurt, in addition to forgiveness 
                            for the transgressor, highlighting the atonement's comprehensive ability to rebuild and 
                            strengthen marital bonds. He said, "Through the atonement, He lifts from us sorrow and pain, 
                            which then gives us the capacity to forgive our spouse when he or she has seriously offended 
                            us" (Miller, 2010, p. 2). This provides light on the atonement's unique role in atonement and 
                            repentance, providing hope for marriages that are strained due to miscommunication and transgressions.

                            <p>
                                Forgiveness and repentance are necessary for healing past hurts and 
                                confusion in a married partnership and it allows couples to put their 
                                disagreements behind them and create a closer, more compassionate bond.

                                Having positive communication and open honesty communication about each other's
                                opinion, feelings and expectations is part of a forgiveness. Because it will let them
                                hear the other persons thoughts without blaming. And establishing awareness to one another known as 
                                having boundaries. This will increases their empathy and compassion in their relationship.

                                    Couples that actively seek and offer forgiveness to one another become closer 
                                    emotionally and shows trust and vulnerability which are key components of emotional 
                                    intimacy.

                                    Resentment is toxic to any relationship and can be remindful by holding onto 
                                    grudges and past mistakes. Getting rid of these hurtful emotions and 
                                    ensuring they don't remain and create further harm can be demonstrate by 
                                    forgiving one another through have an open communication.

                                By allowing both couples to move past complaints and mistakes, forgiveness 
                                reduces resentment and anger, which may let both have a honesty conversation. 
                                In my opinion, repentance and forgiveness from one spouse can heal emotional wounds and create 
                                a more understanding and supporting one another. This will make easier for both partners 
                                to communicate their wants and feelings honestly as a result of this emotional 
                                healing process as they are no longer afraid of judgment.</p>

                                Repentance may allow both couples to comform each other from past mistakes and allow them
                                to gain much more trust in them. Because trust is increased through mutual exchange and become easier
                                for them to have a open communication if they experience the same issues.

                            I have learned so much about forgiveness and repentance from Miller's talks, as I mentioned 
                            above. It shows me the importance of having open communication, which is a great demonstration 
                            of forgiveness and repentance in couples. To strengthen their relationships and improve their 
                            interactions with each other. But I want to share a story and a question that was asked by one 
                            of my group members during our group discussion in week 9 about open communication. She said 
                            what if open communication won't work out in the process of forgiveness and repentance? To solve 
                            this, me and my group collaborated and came up with a solution: praying to our Heavenly Father 
                            for guidance will help us find ways that we can forgive the victim. But more importantly, making 
                            a change in ourselves by showing positive action towards our victim or enemy will help us rebuild 
                            our bond with them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As I studied chapter 20 about forgiveness and repentance, Forgiveness and repentance required 
                            open communication, acknowledging and expressing emotions, and including prayer in planning 
                            to forgive others, which was also supported by Worthington and Wade. "As part of the repentance 
                            process, acknowledging the crime, showing regret, and making reparations are essential steps 
                            that culminate in the victim deciding to forgive" (Worthington & Wade, ch. 20).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So I had an interview with my sister Brianna about apologizing to her for not contributing 
                            to any family chores. One day we had an argument about this issue and ended up not talking 
                            to each other for about a week. This chapter opened up my mind to showing and expressing my 
                            opinions, and I was tempted to ask my sister for an open conversation about this issue. During 
                            our conversation, we both shared reasons for our disagreement about the issue. I told her that 
                            the reason I don't actively do my chores is because I am so overloaded this semester with my 
                            courses. And I sometimes can't sleep the whole night trying to complete my assignments on time. 
                            So she literally understood and apologized to me as well, and we ended up forgiving each other. 
                            Then, after our conversation, we both came up with a solution. She said, "Small things matter." 
                            Even if you contribute a little to our family chores, that counts. Therefore, I agreed. 
                            Eventually, our bond started to rebuild. This interview helped me to understand the importance 
                            of having open communication with my sister. But if open communication doesn't work out, 
                            Making a change in our personal lives by showing positive action and starting to contribute 
                            to our family's chores will help us change our minds about anger, start to forgive each 
                            other, and forget about the issue.
                        </p>
